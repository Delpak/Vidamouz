1
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:13,459
Thank you. Thank you.

2
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,714
Beyond boundaries.

3
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:18,129
What a theme, huh?

4
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:20,424
Now, when I think of boundaries,

5
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:25,415
I think of rules, regulations,
and restrictions.

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:30,126
And I think of the parents, and the
teachers, and the supervisors,

7
00:00:30,126 --> 00:00:33,697
who hold us accountable with
regard to those boundaries.

8
00:00:34,516 --> 00:00:36,100
That's not a bad thing.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,560
Yeah, I know, if you're like
me, I need supervisors,

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,185
I need someone holding me
accountable to do the right thing.

11
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:45,591
But beyond boundaries
is something different.

12
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:50,778
I think of those leaders, those teachers,
those supervisors, those parents

13
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:55,221
who inspire us to go
beyond the call of duty,

14
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,954
to do more than we have to,

15
00:00:57,954 --> 00:01:02,501
to do it not because they tell
us, but because we want to.

16
00:01:03,372 --> 00:01:04,817
I would like to share with you

17
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:08,067
what the research says about
how to make that happen.

18
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,088
And not just for other
people, but for yourself.

19
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:18,850
Here is the deal, how could we inspire
people and ourselves to be self-motivated?

20
00:01:20,273 --> 00:01:23,247
There is another word.
It's called "empowerment".

21
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:24,679
You've heard that word, right?

22
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:27,178
Now, the management
definition of empowerment is,

23
00:01:27,178 --> 00:01:29,439
"Get it done. Just get it done.

24
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,578
With fewer resources and less time,
I empower you, make it happen."

25
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:37,362
I'm talking about
feeling empowered.

26
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,660
That's different.

27
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:41,408
Feeling empowered is when
you're self-motivated.

28
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:44,376
Now, if you want to know
if you feel empowered,

29
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:49,162
or if your child, your student,
your worker feels empowered,

30
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:51,101
ask them three questions.

31
00:01:51,102 --> 00:01:55,635
If they say yes to these three
questions, they will feel empowered.

32
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:56,833
And by the way,

33
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,929
this is not based on common
sense, this is based on research.

34
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:04,120
But you've all been there, so
it'll feel like common sense.

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,901
Question number one: can you do it?
Albert Bandura calls it self-efficacy.

36
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:12,594
Do you believe you can do it?

37
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:16,090
Do you have the time, the
knowledge, and the training

38
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:18,466
to do what we are
asking you to do?

39
00:02:18,467 --> 00:02:20,410
If you answer yes, good.

40
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,959
Second question: will it work?

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,687
Do you believe that what we're asking
you to do, the process, will work?

42
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:32,234
Albert Bandura calls
that response-efficacy:

43
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:36,143
believing that the behavior would
lead to the ultimate outcome.

44
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:39,114
By the way, that
takes education.

45
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:42,614
We have to show them the data,
we might show them some theory,

46
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:46,801
we show them, teach them
why this might work.

47
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:50,948
I just used the word 'education'.
Earlier, I used the word 'training'.

48
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:54,315
Is there a difference?

49
00:02:54,316 --> 00:02:58,036
In elementary school,
we call it education.

50
00:02:58,037 --> 00:03:01,164
Middle school: education.
High school: education.

51
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:05,498
College: higher education.
(Laughter)

52
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:07,645
Then you go to industry,
what do you call it?

53
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,883
Training.

54
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:12,446
You have your training department.
There must be a difference.

55
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,929
Well, you know the difference.

56
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:19,179
Do you want your kids to have
sex education or sex training?

57
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:21,677
(Laughter)

58
00:03:21,677 --> 00:03:24,973
And your kids might answer
the question differently.

59
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:26,493
(Laughter)

60
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:31,760
Because you know that training means you
do the behavior and you get feedback.

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,105
That's powerful. Powerful.

62
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:37,328
Have you ever heard this
word 'online training'?

63
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:40,569
It's an oxymoron, isn't it?

64
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,112
I mean training is to
watch the behavior,

65
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:46,253
but online training is
like plastic silverware,

66
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:51,501
jumbo shrimp, legal
brief, country music.

67
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:54,256
(Laughter)

68
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:55,595
I mean, it doesn't work.

69
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:59,706
OK, so if you answer
yes, till it will work,

70
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,519
third question: is it worth it?

71
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,349
So we've had a training question,
we've had an educational question;

72
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,106
this is the
motivational question.

73
00:04:10,107 --> 00:04:13,522
Do you believe the consequences--
This is about the consequences.

74
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:17,238
B.F. Skinner taught us this:
"selection by consequences".

75
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:20,180
Dale Carnegie quoted B.F.
Skinner and said

76
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,762
that from the day you were born,

77
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,882
everything you did was because you
wanted something for doing it.

78
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:29,419
Consequences. Is it worth it?

79
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,881
So you have to convince
people that it's worth it.

80
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:36,689
Now, by the way, if you answer
yes to those three questions,

81
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:39,367
you feel competent, am I right?

82
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:42,438
You feel competent at
doing worthwhile work.

83
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,786
You've all been there.

84
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:47,132
When you feel competent
at doing worthwhile work,

85
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,627
you're more likely to
be self-motivated.

86
00:04:50,628 --> 00:04:53,814
You've been there. No one
has to look over you.

87
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:56,537
Here is the challenge
leaders, teachers.

88
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:59,481
How do you inspire people
to feel competent?

89
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:03,284
Well, you give them feedback.
You give them recognition.

90
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:06,393
You show them they
are competent.

91
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:12,271
OK. I got one more
another C word: choice.

92
00:05:13,037 --> 00:05:14,948
Your common sense will tell you.

93
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,908
When you believe you have
a sense of autonomy,

94
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:21,723
a sense of choice in what you're
doing, you feel more self-motivated.

95
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:25,451
B.F. Skinner taught us that, too, in
his book "Beyond Freedom and Dignity",

96
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,386
way back in 1971.

97
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:29,040
Reading that book
changed my life,

98
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,166
because I realized that I am
controlled by consequences.

99
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,920
But sometimes I don't
feel controlled.

100
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,315
When I'm working for a
pleasant consequence,

101
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:41,119
it feels good, it feels like
I'm working to get something.

102
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:44,555
When I'm working to avoid
an aversive consequence,

103
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,095
I feel controlled.

104
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,506
That is called negative
reinforcement.

105
00:05:48,506 --> 00:05:50,202
So here is a challenge, leaders:

106
00:05:50,202 --> 00:05:52,965
how do we get people to
become success seekers,

107
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:56,213
rather than failure avoiders?

108
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:58,212
First day of Introductory
Psychology class

109
00:05:58,212 --> 00:06:00,352
- I teach two classes
of 600 students,

110
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:02,883
maybe some of you've been in
that class and remember -

111
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:08,233
the first day I say, "How many
are here to avoid failure?"

112
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,806
And 80% raise your hand.

113
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:15,040
I say, "Well, thanks for coming,
I know you're motivated,

114
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,436
but you are not happy campers.

115
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:18,913
You probably told your friends,

116
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:22,964
'I've got to go to class.
It's a requirement.'

117
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:27,060
Not 'I get to go to class.
It's an opportunity.'

118
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,328
You probably woke up to an alarm
clock not an opportunity clock."

119
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:32,696
(Laughter)

120
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:36,083
It's all in how you see it. Really,
it's all in how you see it.

121
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,330
It's your paradigm.

122
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,666
It's how you communicate to others
and how you communicate to yourself.

123
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:47,042
So, Ellen Langer said in
her book "Mindfulness",

124
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:48,922
- and psychologists know -

125
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:53,766
"When you perceive choice,
you perceive motivation."

126
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,548
You're more motivated.

127
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:58,527
So the deal is, for yourself
sit back and reflect,

128
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:01,458
be mindful of the
choices you have.

129
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:05,251
And talk about being a success seeker,
rather than a failure "avoider".

130
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,700
It's all how you talk, how you
communicate to yourself and to others.

131
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:13,698
I got a fourth C
word: community.

132
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:14,739
Powerful word.

133
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:19,176
Psychologists know that
social support is critical.

134
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,841
People who perceive a
sense of relatedness,

135
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:27,770
a sense of connection with other people,
feel motivated, and they are happier.

136
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:31,495
I want to recite a poem.

137
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:34,602
It's called "The cookie
thief" by Valerie Cox.

138
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:36,597
And as I recite this poem,

139
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:39,187
- there is only two characters,
a men and a lady -

140
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:41,542
put yourself in the situation.

141
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:46,562
Be mindful, think about the
situation and what you would do.

142
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:48,456
OK? Here we go.

143
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:50,505
A woman was waiting at
an airport one night

144
00:07:50,505 --> 00:07:52,959
With several [long] hours
before her flight.

145
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,889
She hunted for a book
in the airport shop

146
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,342
Bought a bag of cookies and
found a place to drop.

147
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:01,629
She was engrossed in her
book but happened to see

148
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:04,537
That the man beside her
as bold as could be

149
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:07,544
[Grabbed] a cookie or two
from the bag between

150
00:08:07,544 --> 00:08:11,428
Which she tried to
ignore to avoid a scene

151
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:14,805
She read, munched cookies,
and watched the clock

152
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:18,330
As this gutsy cookie thief
diminished her stock

153
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,353
She was getting more irritated
as the minutes ticked by

154
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:25,753
Thinking, "If I wasn't so
nice, I'd blacken his eye."

155
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:29,393
With each cookie she
took, he took one too

156
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:31,642
When only one was left she
wondered what he'd do

157
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:34,449
With a smile on his face
and a nervous laugh

158
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:37,741
He took the last cookie
and he broke it in half

159
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:38,931
(Laughter)

160
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:42,289
He offered her a half
as he ate the other

161
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,898
She snatched it from him
and thought, "Oh, brother.

162
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,512
This guy has some nerve,
and he’s also rude.

163
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:51,441
[Why] he didn't even
show any gratitude."

164
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:53,678
She had never known when
she had been so galled

165
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:55,970
And sighed with relief
when her flight was called

166
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,372
She gathered her belongings
and headed for the gate

167
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:02,252
Refusing to look back
at the thieving ingrate

168
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:04,828
She boarded the plane
and sank in her seat

169
00:09:04,829 --> 00:09:08,557
Then she sought her book
which was almost complete

170
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:12,432
As she reached in her baggage,
she gasped with surprise

171
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:15,687
There was her bag of cookies
in front of her eyes

172
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,137
(Laughter)

173
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:21,006
"If mine are here," she
moaned with despair

174
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:25,420
"Then the others were his,
and he tried to share."

175
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:28,745
"Too late to apologize,"
she realized with grief

176
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:33,812
That she was the rude one,
the ingrate, the thief.

177
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,522
So, where were you, when I was--

178
00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:38,977
Where were you? Who's
side were you on?

179
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:43,215
Were you thinking independent?
Or interdependent?

180
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,881
I don't blame you if
you think independent.

181
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:47,076
That's how we are raised.

182
00:09:47,076 --> 00:09:50,745
Nice guys finish last. Squeaky
wheel gets the grease.

183
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:54,049
Gotta blow your own horn.

184
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:55,069
Independent.

185
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:58,390
We come in this life of
ours dependent of others,

186
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:01,370
and then we can't wait
to become teenagers.

187
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,083
We are too old to do what kids do.
Too young to do what adults do.

188
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:09,370
So that we will do that nobody else
would do to assert our independence.

189
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,904
And some of us gets stuck there.
We are stuck.

190
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:16,230
I'll do it myself.
I don't need you.

191
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:17,834
Not good.

192
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:22,154
We need each other. We have
to have each other's back.

193
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,098
We need a sense of community.

194
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:30,267
This independence culture that we got,
we have to move to interdependent.

195
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:35,654
OK, four "C" words that
can fuel self-motivation,

196
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:39,326
and I think can fuel
actively caring for people.

197
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:42,319
Let me tell you a story
to put it all together.

198
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,891
It happened over 60 years ago.
I remember it like yesterday.

199
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:49,452
My parents asked
me, "Hey, Scott.

200
00:10:49,453 --> 00:10:53,644
How would you like to get drum lessons?
How would you like to play the drums?"

201
00:10:53,644 --> 00:10:55,534
Oh man! Would I ever?

202
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:58,513
I'm thinking of Buddy
Rich and Gene Krupa.

203
00:10:58,514 --> 00:11:01,704
Most of you guys don't know those
names, but they were the drummers.

204
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,995
In those days, the drum
was in front of the band.

205
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:07,945
They had White Pearl drum sets, and I
saw it myself. That was my vision.

206
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:10,680
I had a vision: consequences.
That was my vision.

207
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:13,421
And I said, "Yeah, I want
to take drum lessons."

208
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:16,065
So the teacher would bring
his drum set next to mine.

209
00:11:16,065 --> 00:11:17,794
I didn't have a nice
drum like this.

210
00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:20,864
My parents bought me a
beatable drum at an auction.

211
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:26,230
And they said to me, "If you get better,
if your teacher tells us you get--

212
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,935
- they are holding
me accountable -

213
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:31,360
teacher says you are getting better,
we will get you a better snare drum,

214
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,508
and then a bass drum,
and then some cymbals."

215
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:35,705
And that was my vision,
and that kept me going:

216
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:37,366
consequences.

217
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:40,043
So the teacher would come in,
and he would show me stuff:

218
00:11:40,043 --> 00:11:41,456
this is how--, left hand;

219
00:11:41,456 --> 00:11:44,970
this is how Buddy Rich plays with
his left hand and his right hand.

220
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,846
and then he'd do
things like a flam.

221
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:48,415
(Drum)

222
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,332
Can you hear that at the back? You OK?
And this is a rimshot.

223
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:53,507
(Drum)

224
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:56,467
He would show me stuff. I was
just 10 years old, remember?

225
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:58,709
And when he showed me
stuff, I felt, "Wow!"

226
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:02,111
He showed me this little simple drumbeat,
"Watch me, Scott, watch this."

227
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:05,194
(Drum)

228
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:09,169
And I practiced it. And I did it.
I am feeling competent.

229
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:13,711
He showed me a paradiddle, "Listen.
(Playing drums) Paradiddle, paradiddle."

230
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:17,003
"You go home and practice; next week,
I want to see your paradiddling.

231
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,103
I said, "Watch this."

232
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,964
(Drumming)

233
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:22,177
And I said, "Watch this."

234
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:24,044
(Drumming)

235
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:27,703
He said, "That's a double paradiddle.
We didn't get there yet."

236
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:32,398
I am really ahead. (Laughter)
Because I'm self-motivated.

237
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:33,651
I feel competent.

238
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:36,700
I'm walking through Newberg High
School, Allentown, Pennsylvania.

239
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,520
I see the music
teacher, and he says,

240
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,715
"I've heard you're learning
to play the drums."

241
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,290
I said, "Yeah! I'm
getting good."

242
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,450
He said, "You can march in the band.
You can be the snare drummer."

243
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,432
Wow! That felt good.
Another vision.

244
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:51,766
Then the teacher comes into my--

245
00:12:51,766 --> 00:12:56,815
- these are private lessons, by the way,
two dollars, that was a long time ago -

246
00:12:56,815 --> 00:13:00,383
He said, "Scott! Ready
to do a drum roll."

247
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:02,682
I said, "Of course, I'm
ready for a drum roll."

248
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:05,407
And he says, "Watch this, Scott!
Here you go. Watch this."

249
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,777
(Drumming)

250
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,191
"Hmm... could you
do that again?"

251
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:16,061
"Scott. This is easy. Watch me."

252
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,089
(Drumming)

253
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:25,469
"Now, you practice that, and next
week, I want to see your drum roll."

254
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:28,153
He comes back the next week
and says, "How is your drum?"

255
00:13:28,153 --> 00:13:30,824
"Hmm... I can do a
paradiddle." (Drumming)

256
00:13:30,825 --> 00:13:34,667
"That's regression. Ha-ha. I
want to see a drum roll."

257
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:40,323
Week after week, now we're
talking about distress.

258
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:42,691
Now we're talking about apathy.

259
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:45,170
Now we are talking about
learned helplessness.

260
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:47,581
That's what
psychologists call it.

261
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:49,882
I remember walking through
that elementary school

262
00:13:49,882 --> 00:13:52,142
and seeing the music
teacher who said,

263
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:54,690
"So, Scott, how are you doing?
How are the drums?"

264
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,565
"Huh, not so good. I
can't do a drum roll."

265
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:02,177
You know, like adults always
say, " Never say can't.

266
00:14:02,178 --> 00:14:05,025
You can be anything you
want to be, Scott."

267
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:06,827
"No. I can't do a drum roll.

268
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:09,433
I've tried and I tried, and
I've kind of given up."

269
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:13,370
And he says, "Scott, when you ever
get overwhelmed, break it down."

270
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:15,791
Break it down. Can you
do a paradiddle?"

271
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:16,835
"Yeah!"

272
00:14:16,835 --> 00:14:18,712
(Drumming)

273
00:14:18,712 --> 00:14:20,670
"OK, what's the second
beat?" "Two beats."

274
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,962
(Drumming)

275
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:25,802
"Yeah. Well, that's a drum roll, Geller.
It's two beats."

276
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:26,960
(Drumming)

277
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:29,501
You go home and practice, and
you say, "Dad and mama,"

278
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,746
- remember I was just 10 -

279
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,285
"You go 'dad and mama,
dad and mama'."

280
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:36,367
(Drum)

281
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,821
It's a drum roll.

282
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:39,725
That teacher came
back the next week,

283
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:43,357
"OK, Scott. I guess you
can't do a drum roll."

284
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,901
I said, "Watch this."

285
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:47,128
(Drumming)

286
00:14:47,128 --> 00:14:51,066
He said, "Wow! How did
you learn to do that?"

287
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:52,531
And I showed my teacher.

288
00:14:52,531 --> 00:14:54,167
(Drumming)

289
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:58,703
I taught my teacher.
10 years old.

290
00:14:58,703 --> 00:15:03,446
He said, "I've forgotten. I got
into the habit of just doing this

291
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:04,718
(Drumming)

292
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:07,406
and I forgot that
it is two beats.

293
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:11,814
You taught me how to teach
the drum roll, Scott.

294
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:17,180
There is a lesson there: we can
always learn from each other.

295
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,908
We need to have the humility
to accept feedback,

296
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:23,323
and the courage to speak up.

297
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:27,076
And we need to help each
other feel self-motivated.

298
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:28,360
How?

299
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,439
Give them the perception of competence.
Teach them about 'consequences drive us'.

300
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:40,516
Let them perceive choice, and
let them know it's community.

301
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:43,860
We're all in this together.
And we need each other.

302
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:46,152
Thank you.

303
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,613
(Applause)
