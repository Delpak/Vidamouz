00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,860
hi and welcome to the agile Academy

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,090
In this Agile in Practice talk 

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,680
we'd like to show you how agile teams use story cards to capture user requirements

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,860
and to manage the delivery of user functionality

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,670
delivering a new employee performance review system for the HR department is a big piece of work

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,860
 so the team want to chunk it down into smaller pieces

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:27,130
when agile teams capture requirements, they do so from a perspective of the user 

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,450
 hence we call the requirement user stories

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,040
 they are retinal index cards which we then call story cards

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,580
Meet Susan, the business analyst of the team 

11
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,520
 she is having a conversation with our customer Jen

12
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:45,950
 the HR team leader and product owner for the system, together

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,960
 they are identifying some of the user stories 

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,660
 for example:

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,530
 they have identified team leaders as users for the new system

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,050
 one of the stories that Susan captures is:

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,490
 as a team leader I need to see the performance reviews of my team members 

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,380
 so that I can have a conversation with them about their performance

19
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,290
Do you notice the structure that Susan is using?

20
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,750
 "As a ..."
"I need ..."
"So that ..."

21
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,960
 as a team leader refers back to the user who wants this piece of functionality

22
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,480
"I need", tells us what the user wants.

23
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,790
The "So That..." part, describes why the user wants it.

24
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,720
What benefit or value he or she expects to get out of it?

25
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,720
expressing the benefit is important in agile

26
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,550
since we want to deliver value to our customers fast with less risk

27
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,260
 Susan and Jane also discuss acceptance criteria 

28
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,380
 these are the criteria that will let the team know when the story is done 

29
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,490
 Susan captures them in the key statement on the back of the story card 

30
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,520
in short 

31
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:56,930
a story card allows you to record a compelling story that tells you what the user wants and why 

32
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,470
to collect all requirements of the new performance review system

33
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,860
Susan will have many more workshops with Jane and several potential users 

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,050
in order to capture their stories

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,410
The team realized that a story card is too small to gather all the information

36
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,670
 it's just enough to identify the requirement 

37
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,550
we often say that a story card as a promise for a conversation

38
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,350
 just before we start working on the story 

39
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,120
we will come and talk with you to discuss the story in more detail 

40
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,040
 stories on the backlog

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,480
 now that Susan has chunk down the work into smaller pieces, the team can start planning the work 

42
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,650
Susan sticks a story card on the wall
so everyone can see them

43
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,230
great says Bill now we can prioritize and estimate the work

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,040
 prioritizing and estimating the story cards

45
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,710
 will help the team to set an order and the time-line, towards the total work.

46
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,660
Jane and the team are happy 

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,310
the big piece of work is now chunk downed into smaller pieces of work

48
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,230
 and put into a clear order

49
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,320
 in this talk 

50
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,180
you saw how agile team capture user stories with story cards 

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,280
which they then use to prioritize and estimate their work

52
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,810
How agile teams exactly prioritize and estimate the work 

53
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,660
is a topic for another time, and worth checking out on our website.
