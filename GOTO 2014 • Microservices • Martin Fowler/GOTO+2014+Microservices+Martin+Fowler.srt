1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,440
so microservices have been talked about a lot over the last year
سال گذشته در مورد مایکروسرویس ها بسیار صحبت شد
2
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,720
 also I see a huge amount of stuff on Twitter and the like talking about this topic
 من مطالب زیادی در توئیتر و سخنرانی  ها  و صحبتهای مشابه در مورد این موضوع را می بینم
3
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,976
 it's something I've been hearing about for a good bit for a little bit longer
این (مایکروسرویس) چیزی است که برای مدت کمی طولانی تر در موردش شنیدم
4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,888
last two or three years various of my colleagues and friends have been talking about micro services
دو یا سه سال گذشته همکاران و دوستان مختلفم در مورد مایکروسرویس ها سخنرانی کرده اند
5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,416
and for me the struggle was to try and figure out well what exactly are they
6
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,928
what what do people really mean when they talk about microservices
وقتی افراد در مورد مایکروسرویس ها صحبت می کنند دقیقا منظور آنها چیست؟
7
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,608
and also you know when should we consider using this technique 
8
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,744
is it new or not. Do we use it? do we not use it? And what not it is in the first place
9
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:54,912
I mean the basic idea is fairly straightforward
منظورم اینه که ایده اولیه کاملا روشن و قابل درک است
10
00:00:55,776 --> 00:01:01,136
 you contrast it with what's considered to be a traditional monolithic application
11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,968
A monolithic application means you've got various capabilities,
12
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,576
various things that you want to provide
چیزهای مختلفی که می خواهید آماده کنید
13
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:11,320
and you put them all in the same application
و همه آنها را در یک برنامه مشابه قرار می دهید
14
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:13,472
typically running in a single process
15
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:16,560
 and you think of it as one thing
16
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:18,704
the microservice approach
پیشنهاد مایکروسرویس
17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,816
 and its crew disciplines is trying to take each of these capabilities and put them into separate processes
18
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:30,448
 and instead of having one process have this network of communicating processes 
19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,304
a lot of people like to use the example of of the UNIX command line
20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,192
where if you want to get a list of all the files in your directory sorted you might use two or three different programs
21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,080
put together in a pipeline to do so
22
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:46,208
 it also has a consequence for distribution
این همچنین منجر به یک نتیجه برای توزیع شدگی می شود
23
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:54,176
 if you've got a monolith, you scale by effectively cookie cutter in the monolith and putting it on multiple machines 
24
00:01:54,384 --> 00:01:58,384
 while we're microservices you've got more of a flexible approach because you can
25
00:01:58,544 --> 00:02:00,784
put different services on different machines 
سرویس های مختلف را بر روی ماشین های متفاوتی قرار دهید
26
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,424
 so that if some services get more load than others they can have more copies of them made
27
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,336
that's the kind of very crude overview
28
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,056
but this is still a long way away from what I would really call the definition of it
اما هنوز راه طولانی از این مرور اجمالی تا چیزی که واقعا میخواهم تعریف مایکروسرویس ها بنامم وجود دارد
29
00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:20,200
I mean how does this vary from everything I've been hearing people Yammer on about service-oriented architecture for the last 10 years
30
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,944
 but the trouble is with something like a topic like micro services it's very hard to come up with any kind of firm definition
اما نگرانی در مورد موضوعاتی شبیه مایکروسرویس ها این است که رسیدن به هر نوع تعریف ثابت و پایدار بسیار مشکل است
31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,584
yes I mean I've filled the same thing with no sequel right I mean no sequel databases I mean what's the definition and no sequel
32
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:40,880
And even further back I mean you know what is the definition we come up with really solid definition for functional programming
و حتی اگر بیشتر به عقب بر گردیم میدونید، منظورم اینه که تعریفی دقیق و جامعی که برای برنامه نویسی تابعی بهش رسیدیم چی بود؟
33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,088
well you know there are plenty out there you can choose from quite a wide range
خوب شما می دونید که موارد زیادی اینجا وجود داره که می توینید از طیف گسترده و متفاوتی انتخاب کنید
34
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,175
 what I think is better to think about is instead of thinking about a definition to talk about common characteristics
35
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,784
and what I mean by common characteristics is to say
و منظورم از ویژگی های مشترک این است که
36
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,720
if you burnt the talk to AB whole bunch of people doing micro-services
37
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,936
and you look for the common things that most of them are doing
38
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,900
 your test is that most people who say they're doing micro-services should be doing most of these things
39
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,592
and I got together with one of my colleagues who's one of these guys has done a lot of work with microservices
و من با یکی از همکارانم که یکی از افرادی است که کارهای زیادی با مایکروسرویس ها انجام داده همراه شدم
40
00:03:14,688 --> 00:03:19,616
 and we came up with an article that we published earlier this year 
و ما به مقاله ای رسیدیم که در اواویل امسال آنرا منتشر کردیم
41
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,488
 those of you at the back are going to struggle with all that everything on the slides that's at the bottom because of the way the things laid out but it's out there 
42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,624
and I'm just going to summarize some of these these were the nine common characteristics
و من فقط می خواهم برخی از این 9 ویژگی مشترک را خلاصه کنم
43
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:36,010
 that we came up with in writing that article.
که در نوشتن آن مقاله بهشون رسیدیم
44
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,344
and I'm not going to talk through them all because I don't have enough time
و چون به اندازه کافی وقت ندارم  نمی خواهم که در مورد همه ی آن صحبت کنم
45
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,864
but I will highlight some that I think are particularly interesting
ولی برخی از مواردی که فکر می کنم  بوِیژه بیشتر جذاب باشند را برجسته می کنم
46
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:48,656
so the first thing is this notion of componentization via services 
47
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,264
now the idea software should be broken up into components
48
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,976
has been around again forever we always a lot of people have talked about component based software
49
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,100
and how it would be good to have components that you can work with
و چه خوب می شد اگر مولفه هایی داشتید که می توانستید با آن کار کنید
50
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,280
but often the term component of course has had a lot of problems in terms of definition as well
51
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:12,176
I remember a one point object being substituted for components and then
52
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,875
 components came back to objects again and it all got very confusing
مولفه ها مجددا به آبجکت ها بر می گشتند و این بسیار گیچ کننده بود
53
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:21,136
what I focus on for a definition of component really comes from Ralph Johnson
54
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:23,184
he said that what we're trying to do
او در مورد چیزی که ما تلاش می کنیم انجام بدهیم گفت
55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,360
is we're trying to build software the way people would assemble stereo components
ما سعی می کنیم نرم افزار را به روشی تولید کنیم که افراد مولفه های یک استریو را سرهم می کنند
56
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,776
you know you have an amplifier you have speakers you have a CD play have a tape player
میدونید، شما یک بلندگو، اسپیکر ؛ پخش کننده سی دی و پخش کننده ی نوار دارید
57
00:04:31,824 --> 00:04:35,070
 you can replace any of these items independently 
58
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:37,744
that's a crucial thing
و این چیز بسیار مهمی است
59
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:41,312
 and indeed you can upgrade any of these items independently
و مطمئنا می توانید هر کدام از اینها را بصورت مستقل  ارتقا دهید
60
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,400
so if I want to get an improved amplifier I don't have to change everything else
در نتیجه در صورتی که بخواهم یک بلندگو بهتر داشته باشم؛ مجبور نیستم هیچ چیز دیگری را تغییر دهم
61
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,688
 that's a goal of what we're aiming for
62
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,744
 a component is something that's independently replaceable independently upgradable
63
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:57,584
so in terms of software
خوب در اصطلاحات نرم افزار
64
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:01,072
 and we see components to becoming two forms
و مشاهده می کنیم که مولفه ها به دو شکل می آیند
65
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,024
we obtain libraries that we use from third parties and we make them part of our process 
66
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,568
and to some extent we have then the choice of when do we want to upgrade that
67
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,975
 do we want to get a new version of our XML processing library
آیا می خواهیم که نسخه ی جدیدی از کتابخانه پردازش کننده XML بگیریم
68
00:05:15,136 --> 00:05:17,216
or do we stick with the one that we've currently got
یا با چیزی که در حال استفاده از آن هستیم ادامه می دهیم
69
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,456
and hopefully the upgrade isn't going to affect the rest of our application too much
و امیدواریم که ارتقا بر سایر بخش های برنامه ی ما تاثیر زیادی نداشته باشد
70
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:24,160
 depending upon how the dependencies are all laid out
بسته به اینکه وابستگی ها به چه صورت شکل گرفته اند
71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,144
A service is a different kind of component where it's running in its own process 
سرویس نوع دیگری از مولفه است که در فرآیند مخصوص خودش اجرا می شود
72
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,520
 and while with a library we talk using the language
و در حالی که با یک کتابخانه؛ در مورد استفاده از 
73
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,296
 communication facilities that we have built into whatever language we're using
74
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:41,232
with a service we're typically using inter process communication facilities
با یک سرویس؛ عموما ما از توانایی های ارتباطی بین فرآیندها صحبت می کنیم
75
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,776
 such as web service calls or messaging or something of that kind 
76
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,144
and the services give us some useful advantages even when it tends to replace ability and upgrade ability
77
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:56,640
 if I've got a monolith with components that are libraries
78
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,872
and I've got you know somebody brings out a new version of a component that would be really nice
79
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:03,904
but it only works on Java 8
اما نسخه ی جدید فقط در جاوا 8 کار می کند
80
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:09,680
and I've got another component in my monolith that doesn't work with Java 8 and can only work with Java 7 
81
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:11,504
what do I do I'm stuck
چه کار کنم؟ من گیر افتادم
82
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,200
 but on the other hand with if they were separate services they would be running in completely different runtimes 
اما در طرف دیگر اگر آنها سرویس های جدایی بودند که می توانستند در زمان اجرای کاملا متفاوتی اجرا شوند
83
00:06:17,264 --> 00:06:20,048
 and they could operate they could be upgraded more independently
و عمل کنند؛ آنها می توانستند با استقلال بیشتری جایگزین شوند
84
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,480
now there's a cost of course with that
85
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,008
 but that's part of the notion of how it ties into the independent upgrade ability
86
00:06:29,104 --> 00:06:30,512
 so for the next one 
در نتیجه برای مورد بعدی
87
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:38,112
organization in around business capabilities is another important theme in the micro services view of the world 
سازمان پیرامون توانایی های کسب و کار یکی دیگر از موضوعات مهم در چشم انداز دنیای مایکروسرویس های است
88
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:42,464
 so a lot of lot even development organizations
بنابراین خیلی؛ حتی خیلی بیشتر از سازمانهای توسعه
89
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,768
 organize themselves around technology
که خود را پیرامون تکنولوژی سازماندهی می کنند
90
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:50,718
 I mean you'll see this in a lot of big companies I'll have their D bas and their database group
منظورم اینه که شما آنرا در بسیاری از شرکت های بزرگ می بینید و ما DBA و گروه پایگاه داده خودمان را داریم
91
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,288
 that might have a completely different group of people on the UI it's focused around technology
92
00:06:54,608 --> 00:07:01,232
 the key thing with the micro services view of the world is that we should instead organize around business capabilities 
نکته کلیدی با دیدگاه مایکروسرویس ها این است که ما باید در اطراف توانایی های کسب و کار سازماندهی شویم
93
00:07:01,632 --> 00:07:06,368
 and that each team should have some elements right the way through 
94
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:11,008
 and ideally focusing directly on the end users themselves
95
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:14,640
 there's an interesting example of this from Amazon which is a 
یک مثال جالب توجه در این مورد از آمازون که
96
00:07:14,656 --> 00:07:17,888
common certainly inspiration for the micro services community
97
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:23,168
 where when they divided everybody knows Amazon divided themselves up into two pizza teams
98
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,752
and that's talked about a lot
و درباره ی آن بسیار صحبت شد
99
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:28,016
 but what's talked about a lot less often is the fact that each team
و چیزی که کمتر در موردش صحبت شد این حقیقت بود که هر تیم
100
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,608
 was responsible for the communication right way through to the end user experience
مسئول راه ارتباطی مناسب با تجربه کاربر نهایی بود
101
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:37,424
 and the idea that that should connect right the way through to the people at the end 
102
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:45,216
and they should be judged on how does this affect business outcomes right the way through is a very important part of that thinking
103
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:51,072
 so we have this notion of divide yourself up around some kind of business organization
در نتیجه ما این مفهوم را داریم که خود را اطراف یکسری از ساختارهای کسب و کار تقسیم کنیم
104
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:53,712
 and make that as full stack as possible 
105
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,328
perhaps when it comes to comparison to what a lot of people have come across in terms of services
106
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:10,464
one of the biggest shifts is this shift about let's have smart endpoints and dumb pipes
یکی از دگرگونی های بزرگ دگرگونی در مورد داشتن نقاط پایانی هوشمند و لوله های احمق است 
107
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:14,160
 when a lot of people talk about service-oriented architecture
وقتی که افراد زیادی در مورد معماری سرویس-گرا صحبت می کنند
108
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,675
 they talk about the idea of let's get some powerful piece of middle-ware
آنها در مورد ایده ی داشتن یک سری میان افزار قوی صحبت می کنند
109
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:24,944
that will automatically do all sorts of stuff it'll route messages it will apply business rules 
it does all sorts of things
110
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,504
this of course is the the ESB the Enterprise Service bus
این البته ESB است. گذرگاه سرویس سازمان
111
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:33,520
or is it more correctly known the egregious spaghetti box
یا این بیشتر شبیه جعبه ی اسپاگتی بزرگ است
112
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:40,768
the micro-service community very much regret reject this notion
113
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,400
 and says the smarts instead should move to the endpoints themselves
و گفت که هوشمندی ها باید به خود نقاط پایانی منتقل شود
114
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,736
 what we want is everything to connect together
چیزی که می خواهیم این است که همه چیز به هم متصل شود
115
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,640
and to be able to easily route messages or communications between them
و بتوانیم به آسانی پیام ها یا ارتباط های میان آنها را مسیر یابی کنیم
116
00:08:52,784 --> 00:08:56,128
 but it should be up to the endpoints where all that smartness goes 
اما اینها باید وظیفه ی نقاط پایانی باشد؛ جایی که تمام هوشمندی 
117
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:57,792
any business logic
118
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:59,264
 any routing stuff
هر عمل مسیریابی
119
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:03,472
 all of this should be based on the endpoints just give us a good efficient piping mechanism 
120
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:06,752
and the inspiration in many ways is of course the Internet itself
و در بسیاری از راه ها البته خود اینترنت  الهام بخش است
121
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,208
 which works very well
که بخوبی کار می کند
122
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,144
because of the fact that it needs a relatively dumb set of pipes and puts all the intelligence onto the endpoints 
123
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:22,720
another thing that also brings out this 
مورد دیگری که بسیاری از 
124
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,080
variation to a lot of service stuff is the notion of decentralization
این کارهای مختلف را به سرویس های زیادی می دهد مفهوم تمرکز زدایی است
125
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,488
decentralization in terms of the overall way in which a service landscape is governed
126
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,648
 and in particularly decentralization in terms of data management
و بخصوص تمرکز زدایی در شیوه ی مدیریت داده
127
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:41,680
 so again if we think of the the monolithic world
128
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,040
 we think of the fact that generally all of the data is sitting in one honking big relational database
129
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,144
 all right and it's often can be to write across a company
خیلی خب، این می تواند در یک شرکت نوشته شود
130
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,680
 you know our company's standard is Oracle or our company's standard is db2
می دونید، استاندارد شرکت ما اوراکل است، یا شاید استاندارد شرکت ما db2 باشد
131
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,664
everything goes inside box
و هر چیزی درون محدوده می رود
132
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:58,336
 and even a lot of service-oriented architectures
و حتی بسیاری از معماری های سرویس-گرا
133
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:04,784
 it's really a lot about multiple services or pulling data in and out of one logically large database
در واقع بیشتر در مورد سرویس های متعدد یا کشیدن داده در داخل و خارج از یک پایگاه داده منطقی بزرگ است
134
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:09,184
 the micro service appoint point of view is to say now

135
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,664
every service should be responsible for its own data and its own persistence

136
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,600
again this is another thing that is inspired by the Amazon experience

137
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,968
 Amazon made that one of their rules when they shifted to a service-oriented approach 

138
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,630
and said you may never talk to another services data store

139
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:29,060
 you can only talk to another service through its API 

140
00:10:29,392 --> 00:10:33,584
and that's the rule that the micro service people push as well

141
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:36,496
 now this is a couple advantages

142
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,120
 first it removes this horrible mess of integrating through a database 

143
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,680
 which causes no end of problems in enterprises all over the place

144
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:48,864
the second thing it does it frees up individual services

145
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,944
 to use a datastore that make sense to them

146
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,056
 some services a relational database will make sense

147
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:59,152
others would want to use one of these hot new NoSQL fancy things

148
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:01,184
 and in which case they use it for that 

149
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,544
but the idea is yours choice of data persistence 

150
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,776
 should be entirely up to the individual service themselves 

151
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,360
and that's part of this general notion as I said of decentralization

152
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,816
 it also goes to the point of things like languages and tools

153
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,512
 should again be individually chosen by different service groups

154
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,232
 to make all of this work it's really important to have infrastructure automation

155
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:32,160
 so a lot of things such as continuous delivery 

156
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:35,760
techniques like Blue Green deployment that allow you to 

157
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:38,784
put stuff to live with zero downtime

158
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,824
 these kinds of things are mandatory in too in order to get this kind of stuff to work

159
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:47,216
 because you're talking about building what would be one application

160
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:49,664
 as a dozen or two dozen services

161
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,712
so it's very important you have a very automated way of getting these things going

162
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,120
you also want to be able to get new boxes and spin them up rapidly 

163
00:11:57,328 --> 00:12:00,800
 it also puts a lot of emphasis on monitoring as well 

164
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:03,360
you've got to have good monitoring 

165
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,408
so that when things go wrong you can easily spot the fact that something's gone wrong

166
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,728
and you can use the monitoring tools to help you debug it

167
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,680
And that of course then leads into the notion that you have this explicit design for failure

168
00:12:16,096 --> 00:12:18,080
 if you're going to have remote services

169
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,464
they're going to fail. particularly as you distribute them across multiple nodes 

170
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,875
so this is another part of the reason why monitoring is so important

171
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,376
and of course it's most famous level

172
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:31,840
 you have things like the chaos monkey

173
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:37,424
 Netflix is one of the most well known microservice architectures

174
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:43,024
 and they built a tool that goes around randomly destroying nodes

175
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,760
 and they use that in order to detect 

176
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,592
how resilient their overall network is

177
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:53,150
I mean I don't run it all the time they run it during office hours when there's somebody there to fix things up

178
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:56,816
 but the fact that you've got a tool that deliberately causes failure

179
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:59,104
 in order to help make sure you're resilient

180
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,125
 I think it encapsulate story well, the attitude that the micro service people have 

181
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:09,525
and of course this is essential in any kind of distributed system you have to assume things are going to break

182
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,875
so that was our set of common characteristics

183
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,000
 and I hope gives you a bit of a flavor for the kinds of things that people talk about

184
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:22,125
but it still raises a number of questions

185
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:26,275
 of which one of the biggest things is is this really service-oriented architecture

186
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,600
 is this just the same kind of stuff that we've been hearing about for a long time in the context of SOA 

187
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,850
but in order to answer that question 
you have to say to yourself well what is SOA in the first place

188
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,900
 and that is really I think at the heart of the problem

189
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,800
because I've heard SOA defined in many different ways in many different incompatible ways by different people

190
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:53,100
for some people, SOA is exactly what we've been talking about in the microservice world

191
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,350
 and that's why I met a number of people in the SOA community 

192
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,950
a really ticked off at the micro service people

193
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:05,925
 because their attitude is well we've been doing all of this and calling it SOA for years why do you invent this new term and bring it along

194
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:12,750
 what is are you just calling words because everybody knows of course 
we become incredibly rich by coining terminology

195
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,125
 I wish

196
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,550
 but of course SOA means different things to different people

197
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,200
 to many people in the micro services community

198
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:28,300
they've been around big enterprises and to them SOA means the enterprise service bus 

199
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:35,025
 it means Committees of people who are there to
 lay down standards the health services supposed to connect to each other

200
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,825
 it's a very different world indeed

201
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,000
 so the way I tend to think of it is saying well SOA is this very broad term

202
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:46,325
and micro-services is a subset of its usage

203
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,250
 and the value of the term micro services

204
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,750
 is it allows to put a label on a useful subset of the SOA terminology 

205
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,525
in my view the SOA term is too broad

206
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,000
I mean it means so many different things it's practically meaningless

207
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:08,850
 but the value of micro services is it carves out a cut and consistent space within that 

208
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,150
but he is perfectly fair to say

209
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:17,375
 that the micro service approach has been done by people under the name of SOA for at least a decade if not more 

210
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,725
so it's not a new technique at all

211
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:25,700
And it's perfectly reasonable that people are annoyed about it when they say Oh micro services are nothing new 

212
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,700
that's a perfectly reasonable response

213
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,275
now one of the problems with micro-services as a term

214
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,400
And I like to stress I didn't come up with this term right I would have come up with a better term

215
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,350
 but one of the things about micro-services as a term is that has this implication of size

216
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:50,800
 and of course as soon as you say micro is that well how big is a micro service

217
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,975
And you actually talk to any of these people in the micro service world and they're always very reluctant to answer this question

218
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,475
they always say well you know it should be one responsibility

219
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:07,675
 that's a kind of bogus thing to say right I can imagine payroll being one responsibility and I know that's a pretty big system

220
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:13,575
 right I mean it's all size I mean it's very responsibilities are very flexible right 

221
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:20,650
 james lewis has this statement he says mirco services have got to be small enough to fit in my head

222
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,575
 now James has config rate deal in his head, as it turns out

223
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,350
but his point is of course the survey that if you've got a service it should be understandable to a single person

224
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,625
that's his test for it but that's still a bit vague

225
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,250
 I started asking around people trying to get a sense of size

226
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:41,900
people were extremely reluctant in many ways

227
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,350
But the way I was able to get some figure by saying well 

228
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:48,500
how many people per service in your application 

229
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,375
 and I got a lot of different answers

230
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,025
 and as you can see there's quite a spread here

231
00:16:54,475 --> 00:16:58,300
 Now 15 people 10 services 

232
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:00,775
four people 200 services

233
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,975
 there's quite a range of different sizes

234
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:11,300
 it's certainly true that pretty where everywhere, come across the notion of the two pizza team

235
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:15,050
from Amazon is fairly well regarded

236
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,350
the sense that you should never have a team that's bigger than you could feed with two pizzas 

237
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:25,900
 I should say of course this is two American pizzas and you can feed a hell of a lot of people with two American pizzas

238
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,275
 but I think the notion is still there

239
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,800
but within there's still a lot of variability

240
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,400
 so that's the best I can do when it comes to defining micro-services for you

241
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,625
 it's still I'm afraid pretty fuzzy

242
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,850
 but you know that's the way things go

243
00:17:44,025 --> 00:17:48,400
 I think however it is it does carve out a reasonable class of systems 

244
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,525
the next question of course is when you should use it

245
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:55,250
 what are the advantages of micro-services compared to monoliths

246
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:06,275
 now one big advantage of a monolith is it a relatively simple and familiar approach to use

247
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,000
 and this is not to be underestimated

248
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,275
 I mean I've already started hearing and trickling in stories of projects that

249
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,625
 you know decide you know we want to use this micro-service stuff because it's so cool we want to do it

250
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,800
 and they ended up getting themselves into trouble where they really should have built a simple model if instead

251
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,025
now if you look at an application and you say yeah that would work really nicely as a simple rails app

252
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,075
 you don't want to build start building it as a micro service

253
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:35,325
because micro services introduced distributed computing

254
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,850
 they often introduced asynchronous communication 

255
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,675
and those are significant complexity boosters

256
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:46,900
 so the monolith still has the advantage of up to a certain size at least simplicity 

257
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:55,200
one of the great advantages of micro services is the ability to deploy the various pieces independently 

258
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,450
 if you want to upgrade a monolith, you've got to upgrade the whole thing

259
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:06,175
 I heard the story of an insurance company where they've got one monolith that handled all their different lines of insurance

260
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:09,825
if they wanted to in to upgrade their auto insurance

261
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:11,825
 they had to upgrade the home insurance

262
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,950
as well they couldn't do them independently

263
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,500
 and that's a disadvantage of a monolith

264
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:18,720
 you're forced to upgrade all at once

265
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,250
 now if you're really good at your continuous delivery pipelines

266
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:23,675
 I think you can make that work 

267
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:28,725
but you but it's much harder than trying to upgrade and the separate pieces

268
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,800
 and that was in fact one of the crucial reasons why Netflix went down this route

269
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:38,025
they had difficulties getting their systems being able to deploy as rapidly as they need to do

270
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,975
so they found that switching to a micro service approach gave them more flexibility

271
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,200
and this is of course very important in to an age

272
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,475
 where we need to be able to deploy new applications not once every few months

273
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:53,925
but every week every day and often many times a day 

274
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:59,400
and then we are granted your micro services that can give you a greater degree of availability

275
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,350
 if your recommendation service goes down for some reason 

276
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,600
you can still run your shopping cart 

277
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:09,925
and this is important because what is the most important thing to Americans 

278
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:14,500
shopping!
right so nothing must stop the shopping

279
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:21,150
 now that availability of course comes from being handled be able to handle failure effectively 

280
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,675
but if you've got availability what does that mean you lose

281
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,650
Consistency!

282
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:32,375
it's much harder to maintain consistency with micro service applications

283
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:35,075
so you embrace eventual consistency

284
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:39,550
 which may or may not be a good thing depending on what where you 

285
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,250
 are and it's particularly difficult of course to get the right kind of consistent behavior

286
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:51,000
 so that I can actually post an update when interacting with a web app and actually make sure that I see it 

287
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,900
and not go where did that go did it get lost 

288
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,325
which is the kind of thing that goes wrong when you don't do consistency well

289
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:07,075
 another big issue we've modeled with the monolith is that it makes it relatively easy to re-factor particularly between modules

290
00:21:07,325 --> 00:21:10,900
now with any kind of software design you want good modularity 

291
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,500
you want to divide your software up into pieces

292
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,450
 so that in order to make a change I don't have to understand the whole system

293
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,000
 I can just understand one or two modules

294
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:23,400
 but that means you've got to get your module boundaries right

295
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,075
 and if you don't get your module boundaries right you've got to be able to change them 

296
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,475
now if you've got a monolith, that kind of thing isn't too bad 

297
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:35,020
you can say: Oh I need to move this object from over here in that module over there

298
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:36,900
 it's not a hard re-factoring to do

299
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:40,900
 in a micro-services world that becomes a hell of a lot harder

300
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:44,725
 because now you're talking about these remote calls 

301
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:49,950
so that's also I think one of the problems with running to monitor micro services too quickly

302
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,500
if you don't understand the module boundaries well 

303
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:55,775
you've very easy to get a lock yourself into a pure design 

304
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:02,275
and a monolith can be a good way of figuring out module boundaries are, before you actually do the split

305
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:08,775
and we said that one of the interesting things about micro-services is that they actually help you preserve modularity

306
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:14,525
 a lot of people you know, like me waffle on endlessly about how important it is to have good modules

307
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,300
 now follow bob Martin's rules, about clean, dependencies, and all the rest of it 

308
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,975
but the reality is most systems find it hard to do it in practice

309
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:29,850
 it's too easy to kind of do little end runs around and expose little things and not keep your module boundaries solid 

310
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:36,625
on the other hand in a micro service world your communications are purely through your network interfaces 

311
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:43,250
and it's maintained it makes it really easy to ensure you don't share mutable state 

312
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:49,525
which is of course one of the best ways to get yourself into a confusion in a monolith module architecture 

313
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:56,375
so in many ways micro service is kind of a discipline that forces you to keep your modularity together

314
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:04,160
 and then I mean the last big advantage in micro services they allow you to go with multiple platforms

315
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:06,625
 if some parts of your application stack

316
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,250
 are best off with a traditional you know Java whatever language

317
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:17,520
 you can use them in some places and then you use sort or an even experiment with say a closure on other areas 

318
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:25,150
 you've got the flexibility now of course you don't necessarily want to go so mad that you've got 20 services written in 30 programming languages

319
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:28,625
 but on the other hand that flexibility can be very valuable

320
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:37,225
 just as you don't know use JavaScript that's the one thing I really don't want anybody to do 

321
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:41,370
 you've got to fight back against that monster somehow

322
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,225
 so that's the trade-offs 

323
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,550
 microservices are not straightforward route to go

324
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,750
 in many ways I'd say if you're not sure if you've got a relatively small system don't worry about it 

325
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:58,950
 but on the other hand they can be an appropriate architecture in a lot of places

326
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,000
 and we're still trying to understand what the boundaries are between them

327
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:03,475
it's still fairly early

328
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:09,100
 and then the last point I want to say is 
if you're going to go down the micro-service point

329
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:14,450
 there are certain things you've got to make sure that you get sorted out otherwise you're going to get into a lot of trouble

330
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,800
you've got to make sure that you can provision new machines rapidly

331
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:25,375
if you're in a situation where it takes you a month to get a new server set up and provisioned and ready for use

332
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,800
 you're going to have a lot of problems in the micro service world 

333
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,150
this is of course why micro services go very nicely with cloud

334
00:24:31,275 --> 00:24:34,400
if you can provision a new machine in the cloud very quickly

335
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:40,350
 which is for instance what Netflix do then that allows you a lot of flexibility there 

336
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:43,950
make sure you have at least the basics of monitoring

337
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,225
 you want to know when any of your services go down 

338
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,575
you want to know if something becomes unresponsive 

339
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,850
 or if important interactions or transactions are getting dropped on the floor

340
00:24:54,975 --> 00:24:58,250
 you've got to have at least a basic level of monitoring in place 

341
00:24:58,575 --> 00:25:01,575
and also you've got to make sure that your services

342
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:04,475
 can be automatically and rapidly deployed 

343
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,850
and you don't want to be spending two days deploying the service 

344
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,325
it's got to be there in hours at the very least and preferably minutes

345
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,225
 and it should be as much as possible automatic process

346
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:20,500
 that's just the basics that's just for running with just a couple of certain amount of services

347
00:25:20,725 --> 00:25:23,000
 and to do more you've got to add more 

348
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,325
there's a whole bunch of other stuff that you've got to get into play as well

349
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:29,150
 so make sure you've at least got those basics

350
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,900
 On the one I missed DevOps culture

351
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:38,100
 that is you've got to break down the barriers between the operations group in the applications group so that they're working together 

352
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:46,375
 if you've got a difficult communications between the two again you're not going to be able to manage the quantity of services that you've got to deal with

353
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,200
so as I said those I think are the minimum things to have, when you first go live

354
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,400
 you don't necessarily have to have them when you start building

355
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,575
 but you definitely have to have them when you go live with this thing

356
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,275
so that's microservices

357
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:02,875
 a very brief introduction

358
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,318
I've written various things on it there's tons of stuff out there on the web

359
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:10,875
you can go and find out more and that's the end of my first talk
