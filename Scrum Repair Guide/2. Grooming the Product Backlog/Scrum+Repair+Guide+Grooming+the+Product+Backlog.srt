1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,320
حول یک تیم اسکرام بیش از یک دقیقه پرسه بزنید
hang around a scrum team for more than a few minutes

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,170
و احتمالا سازماندهی کردن بک لاگ ها را خواهید شنید
 and you'll probably hear the term product backlog grooming

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,230
یک مفهومی که در میان تیم های اسکرام در چند سال گذشته خیلی رایج شده 
 this is a concept that has gotten very popular among scrum teams over the past few years

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,170
به خوبی نگهداری کردن بک لاگ ها اشاره دارد
 it refers to the idea of keeping the product backlog well maintained 

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,130
چونکه بک لاگی که خوب نگهداری شده 
می تواند مشکلات زیادی را حل کند
since a well-maintained product backlog
can solve a lot of problems

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,430
اجازه دهید ببینیم سازماندهی کردن بک لاگ محصول به چه معناست
 let's see exactly what grooming the product backlog means 

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,510
در نخستین روزهای اسکرام
 in the early days of scrum 

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,440
با بک لاگ محصول خیلی شبیه به کشویی است که همه ما در آشپزخانه 
 the product backlog was treated pretty much like that drawer we all have in our kitchens

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,760
یا جای دیگر خانه داریم
 or somewhere in the house 

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,530
 you know the one full of all sorts of junk you don't have any better place for

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,060 
 the product backlog was just the place early scrum teams but anything they needed to remember to do 

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,010
 نیاز  نبود آیتمها به روشی نوشته شوند که تیم بعدا بخاطر بیاورد معنی آن چیست
The items weren't necessarily written in a way that the team would later remember what the items meant 

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,900
و مسلما تیم بصورت منظم زمان روی آن اختصصاص نمی داد
 and team certainly didn't have regular time devoted 

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,570
برای پاکسازی این بک لاگهای آشفته اولیه 
to clean up these messy, early product backlogs

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,700
تیم به زودی متوجه شد که اسپرینت بخوبی عمل کرده است اگر
well team soon learned that Sprint's went a whole lot better

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,740
 بک لاگها به شکل خوبی نگهداری شوند  
 if the product backlog was looked after and kept in good shape

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,560
یا به عبارت دیگر سازماندهی شوند
 or in other words groomed 

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,890
 let's see what type of activities make up product backlog grooming 

19
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,370
here we have a typical product backlog 

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,120
grooming a product backlog usually involves a handful of separate actions

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,400
 first, new items can be added to the product backlog

22
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,300
usually this will be something a product owner will do

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,890
 but product owners often have questions for the rest of the team 

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,940
that affect where the new item will be put in the product backlog 

25
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,370
 minimally a product owner will usually want at least a guess from the team

26
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,260
 about how long a product backlog item will take to develop 

27
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,950
if a particular product backlog item isn't going to take long to develop 

28
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,200
The product owner may want it immediately

29
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,670
 but if that same item is going to take a long time to develop

30
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,530
 it will usually go further down on the product backlog 

31
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,890
second and along the lines of adding new items

32
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,410
 is re-prioritizing product backlog items

33
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,830
 we may have an angry customer who needs some feature now 

34
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,160
so that gets moved up in the product backlog

35
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,260
 or usage data on a released feature

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,530
 may tell us that something in the product backlog

37
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,360
isn't needed as urgently as once thought 

38
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,430
so that item gets moved down 

39
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,550
 a third action that could be considered part of backlog grooming

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,660
 is splitting larger product backlog items to smaller ones 

41
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,050
as items at the top of the product backlog are developed

42
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,160
 and removed from the product backlog 

43
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,580
the top priority items, are ones that were previously lower 

44
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,950
as an item nears the top of the product backlog

45
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,890
 it is important that it is small enough that a team can finish it in a single sprint

46
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,480
so part of backlog grooming involves discussing any items that are nearing the top of the product backlog

47
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,150
 and it may be too large to complete in a sprint

48
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,800
 those items are split 

49
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,350
and the new smaller stories put back into the product backlog where they belong

50
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,320
 they often belong in different places, as shown here

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,250
 because these sub items can be of differing priorities 

52
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,700
along the same lines is splitting up a product backlog item 

53
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,060
is adding detailed with those product backlog items

54
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,630
 that will soon be brought into a sprint

55
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,870
 when working with user stories as product backlog items

56
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,780
 these details are commonly called conditions of satisfaction or acceptance criteria 

57
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,690
but whatever they're called they are essentially high-level tests for a product backlog item

58
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,300
many teams had discovered the benefit of establishing a definition of ready

59
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,790
before any product backlog item can be brought into a sprint 

60
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,240
it must comply with the team's definition of ready 

61
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,410
product backlog grooming is where top priority backlog items are assessed against the definition of ready 

62
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,630
by doing this in advance of the sprint planning meeting

63
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,670
 the product owner is given a chance to add any missing details before that meeting

64
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,940
 one last action that makes up product backlog grooming

65
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,200
 is throwing away product backlog items that will never be done 

66
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,880
that old item in your product backlog about adding support for extended memory on dos 5.0 

67
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,670
get rid of it if 

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,470
you haven't done it by now you're never going to

69
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,490
 I'm the first to admit that for many product owners

70
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,990
 throwing items away is easier said than done

71
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,860
I think I'm finally cured 

72
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,850
 but for years I would just store old product backlog items in a spreadsheet 

73
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,770
I never looked at the items again

74
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,610
 but they were there if I needed them

75
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,090
 now I've learned to just throw them away

76
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,150
 so if you're uncomfortable getting rid of things completely

77
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,380
 create a spreadsheet and call it your long-term product backlog 

78
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,810
separating things that realistically will never get done

79
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,490
from the higher priority items 

80
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,320
can make a big difference in keeping the product backlog from reaching an unmanageable size

81
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,840
 in this video

82
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,740
 I've talked about five things that make up like backlog grooming

83
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,880
I haven't talked though about who does it and when

84
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,600
 there's a bit of debate about that in the scrum community

85
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,240
 which I'll address in the next video
