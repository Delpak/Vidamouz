Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:02.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Hi! and welcome to the agile Academy
Dialogue: 0,0:00:02.87,0:00:04.80,Default,,0,0,0,,in this Agile in practice talk
Dialogue: 0,0:00:04.87,0:00:07.89,Default,,0,0,0,,we'd like to show you how developers on an agile team
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.94,0:00:13.06,Default,,0,0,0,,use pair programming to work defects, help deliver faster, and produce higher quality work
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.12,0:00:15.60,Default,,0,0,0,,let's have a look at how this practice works
Dialogue: 0,0:00:15.68,0:00:20.10,Default,,0,0,0,,the way developers are collaborating is a bit like driving a car on a rally
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.23,0:00:23.90,Default,,0,0,0,,one of you is driving while the other is navigating reading the map
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.97,0:00:26.44,Default,,0,0,0,, while the driver is keeping their eyes in the road
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.49,0:00:30.11,Default,,0,0,0,, the Navigator is focusing on the destination and how to get there
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.29,0:00:32.35,Default,,0,0,0,,regardless of the kind of work you do
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.40,0:00:35.63,Default,,0,0,0,, you may want to try out collaborating with a colleague in the same way
Dialogue: 0,0:00:35.68,0:00:38.22,Default,,0,0,0,, especially when you are dealing with a difficult task
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.30,0:00:40.57,Default,,0,0,0,,it works based if both people are pairs
Dialogue: 0,0:00:40.60,0:00:44.70,Default,,0,0,0,, sharing the same role and having a similar skill and experience level
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.88,0:00:46.59,Default,,0,0,0,,here are Bill and Liz
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.67,0:00:52.23,Default,,0,0,0,,2 developers from the agile team who are delivering a new employee performance review system for the HR department
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.43,0:00:55.51,Default,,0,0,0,, they will be working together side by side at the same computer
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.55,0:00:57.09,Default,,0,0,0,, solving the same problem
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.16,0:00:59.83,Default,,0,0,0,,they take turns using the keyboard and mouse
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.93,0:01:02.24,Default,,0,0,0,,at the moment liz is the driver
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.30,0:01:05.59,Default,,0,0,0,,while she is writing the code and performs tests on that code
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.82,0:01:08.35,Default,,0,0,0,, bill as a navigator observes her work
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.44,0:01:10.36,Default,,0,0,0,,considering the strategic direction
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.44,0:01:12.71,Default,,0,0,0,,the next steps and potential pitfalls
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.78,0:01:16.01,Default,,0,0,0,, he also considers if this is a simplest design possible
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.06,0:01:18.18,Default,,0,0,0,, and comes up with ideas for improvement
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.24,0:01:19.88,Default,,0,0,0,, after the period of time
Dialogue: 0,0:01:19.95,0:01:22.86,Default,,0,0,0,, they swap rules and Liz navigates while Bill drives
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.90,0:01:26.12,Default,,0,0,0,,because they are constantly communicating and reviewing together
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.17,0:01:30.28,Default,,0,0,0,, they produce higher quality work at a faster pace than either could do on their own
Dialogue: 0,0:01:30.34,0:01:34.73,Default,,0,0,0,, it also ensures that more than just one developer\N knows each part of the system
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.86,0:01:37.36,Default,,0,0,0,, pair swap places frequently throughout the day
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.40,0:01:40.86,Default,,0,0,0,, and also new pairs are formed to promote sharing of knowledge throughout the team
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.02,0:01:44.19,Default,,0,0,0,, at the same time a uniform style of planning is carried out
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.27,0:01:46.28,Default,,0,0,0,, which makes working together easier
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.40,0:01:49.85,Default,,0,0,0,, it also creates an ownership and commitment to the collective code
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.97,0:01:53.06,Default,,0,0,0,, despite the benefits, pair program is not always easy
Dialogue: 0,0:01:53.21,0:01:56.05,Default,,0,0,0,, as a driver you have someone observing you constantly
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.10,0:02:01.83,Default,,0,0,0,,and when you're navigating you need to refrain from rushing to point out details like messing semicolons or typos
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.03,0:02:04.76,Default,,0,0,0,,instead you need to get the driver time to write
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.79,0:02:08.13,Default,,0,0,0,,and rewrite the work while you focus on the direction the work is going
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.36,0:02:13.68,Default,,0,0,0,, also you should consider that pair programming isn't suitable for all tasks or situations
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.74,0:02:17.39,Default,,0,0,0,,but if you choose to do it, you need to respect each other, communicate
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.42,0:02:20.59,Default,,0,0,0,,and make it easy on yourselves by using a computer with a big screen
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.77,0:02:22.14,Default,,0,0,0,, enjoy the right
Dialogue: 0,0:02:22.23,0:02:24.14,Default,,0,0,0,, in this agile in practice talk
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.24,0:02:30.03,Default,,0,0,0,, you saw how agile teams collaborate and use a practice of pair programming to increase the quality of the work
Dialogue: 0,0:02:30.06,0:02:33.85,Default,,0,0,0,,you may also from time to time hear the term pairing news to
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.94,0:02:39.86,Default,,0,0,0,, this can refer to 2 business people or one business person \Nand a developer working together on one piece of work
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.01,0:02:44.79,Default,,0,0,0,,you can see that building quality into a task isn't just limited to IT folks anymore
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.88,0:02:48.01,Default,,0,0,0,, pairing can also encourage the pairs to take pride in their work
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.05,0:02:50.06,Default,,0,0,0,,because they are sharing it with someone else
