00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,480
in this video we'll learn all about the sprint planning meeting

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,705
we will cover the inputs to the meeting,

3
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:13,744
the goals,

4
00:00:13,744 --> 00:00:15,114
who attends,

5
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:16,591
the time box ,

6
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:21,217
the general approach to running the meeting

7
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:22,940
and the outputs

8
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:29,269
as its name implies the sprint planning meeting is used to plan the work of the sprint

9
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:33,660
the meeting doesn't happen before the sprint starts,

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,070
but is the first event within the sprint

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,759
this is true of all scrum events

12
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:43,470
everything happens within a sprint and there is no pause between sprints

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,026
the sprint planning meeting has two primary goals

14
00:00:48,026 --> 00:00:51,481
first determine what can be delivered in the sprint

15
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:54,619
and second to plan how to achieve that delivery

16
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,729
the entire scrum team attends the sprint planning meeting

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,090
the product owners role tends to be more active during discussions of what can be delivered

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:12,130
and less active while the development team plans how to achieve the delivery participating as questions arise

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,940
the sprint planning meeting is time boxed to eight hours for a one-month sprint

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,760
for shorter sprints the time box is shorter

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,039
a standard guideline is two hours of planning for every one week of sprint

22
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,616
remember a time box is a maximum amount of time

23
00:01:30,616 --> 00:01:33,680
not a minimum or suggested amount of time

24
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:39,010
many experienced scrum teams regularly spend far less than the time box in sprint planning

25
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,840
all scrum events are time boxed

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,340
with a limited amount of time the team feels a sense of urgency to accomplish the goals of the time boxed event

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,269
nearly all people work most effectively when there are realistic,

28
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:58,339
but honored deadlines in place

29
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:07,530
since the team knows there is limited time they tend to focus on accomplishing the most important things during that time

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,760
skilled scrum masters use the time box as a reason to move the conversation along when it is not serving the meetings purpose

31
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:22,300
in this way time boxes are a constraint that help focus on the value we can add by collaborating

32
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,700
Parkinson's law states that work expands to fill the time allotted

33
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,811
in everyday terms this means that a meeting that is scheduled for one hour

34
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:36,590
will tend to take the full hour regardless of what gets accomplished

35
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:43,960
rather than allotting the exact amount of time a scrum event will take, scrum specifies the maximum time the time box

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,210
a skilled scrum master will help the team focus only on accomplishing the goals of the meeting

37
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,330
experienced scrum teams should find that many scrum events are accomplished well before the time box expires

38
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,690
the sprint planning meeting is typically divided into two parts

39
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:09,570
historically these were referred to as Part A and Part B though that language is not part of the current official scrum guide

40
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,380
instead, the scrum guide refers to two topics of discussion,

41
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,180
related to the two goals what can be delivered and how will we deliver it

42
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:27,030
the four inputs to the meeting are the latest product increment if the Sprint is for ongoing development,

43
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,643
the current product backlog ,

44
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,907
the projected capacity of the development team during this sprint

45
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:39,040
and past performance of the development team

46
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,952
the first two inputs the increment and product backlog

47
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:47,270
help us inspect and adapt on the product itself

48
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,220
what is the most important thing to deliver. which we can use to craft the Sprint goal

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,480
the second two inputs are related to understanding how much can we take on

50
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:08,070
past performance is helpful guidance to the team to understand what on average they can achieve during a given sprint

51
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:18,480
an analogy from the sports world is that historic performance would be like the average number of points scored per game for a team over the course of an entire season

52
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,920
it is a good long-term guideline

53
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,910
capacity in the sports analogy would be to look at tonight's game assessing who is on the active roster,

54
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:34,950
whether the team might be fatigued from the recent schedule and the strengths and weaknesses of tonight's opponent

55
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,190
a scrum team might consider various individuals plan to time off

56
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,560
or other commitments inside and out of work the specific product backlog items under consideration

57
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,860
and what skills are required to deliver them any holidays that might fall within the Sprint etc

58
00:04:52,010 --> 00:05:00,000
with these inputs in place the scrum team enters into the first topic of discussion what can be achieved in the sprint

59
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,070
this is accomplished by the scrum team collaborating to understand all of the inputs

60
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,670
and finally by the development team polling product backlog items into the Sprint

61
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,829
only the development team can make this assessment of what to pull into the sprint

62
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:23,750
and any attempt by others outside of the development team will lead to some sort of dysfunction and typically to a reduction in quality

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,170
experience scrum teams tend to spend very little time on the first topic since they actively refine the product backlog on an ongoing basis

64
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:40,490
once the development team has made their forecasts for what can be achieved in the Sprint,

65
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,530
the entire scrum team collaborates to choose a sprint goal

66
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,469
the Sprint goal helps clarify the overarching purpose of the Sprint

67
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:53,900
understanding the purpose and impact of the work is a critical factor in creating high-performing teams

68
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,619
with the selected product backlog items and a sprint goal in place,

69
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:05,480
the scrum team moves into the second topic of discussion how will the chosen work get done

70
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:14,370
the selected product backlog items are now contained in the sprint backlog which is the development teams plan for the sprint

71
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:21,370
they collaborate to design the system and decompose the work required to deliver the selected product backlog items

72
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,770
these details are added to the sprint backlog

73
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:32,590
effective development teams tend to decompose all work into small units that can be completed in no more than a day or two

74
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:39,040
the ensure that all work required to meet the team's definition of done is captured in the sprint backlog

75
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,860
as the development team creates the sprint backlog,

76
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,923
they may discover that the work was larger than forecasted

77
00:06:46,923 --> 00:06:52,440
in which case they discuss with the product owner what might be removed while still meeting the Sprint goal

78
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,450
or if the Sprint goal should be revised

79
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:02,450
the product owner also answers any new questions that arise about the details of the product backlog items that have been selected

80
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,620
when the meeting is complete,

81
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:11,990
the development team should be able to explain how they plan to act as a self-organizing unit  to deliver a working product increment,

82
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:18,670
that meets the Sprint goal and contains all of the capabilities represented by the selected product backlog items

83
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:26,260
the outputs of the sprint planning meeting then are a finalized sprint goal and the development team sprint backlog

84
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,800
with those in place the development team is ready to begin working on the items in the sprint backlog
