1
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:10,769
in another section we describe the product backlog as a constantly evolving artifact

2
00:00:10,894 --> 00:00:12,302
that is never complete

3
00:00:12,917 --> 00:00:18,371
product backlog refinement is the work that is done to constantly evolve the product backlog

4
00:00:19,337 --> 00:00:28,356
most product backlogs were at some point in unsorted collection of ideas for features enhancements improvements and capabilities for a product

5
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:36,263
to provide transparency and focus the product owner collaborates with the other members of the scrum team to refine those ideas

6
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:41,678
adding details estimates and in order to each item

7
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:49,389
they also ensure that any single product backlog item that is likely to be pulled into the next sprint

8
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:54,535
is small enough to reasonably reach the definition of done within the sprint time box

9
00:00:55,169 --> 00:01:02,179
once the items at the top of the ordered product backlog have these characteristics they are considered ready for sprint planning

10
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,344
while it is possible to go through product backlog refinement for every known item in the product backlog

11
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:14,014
the focus is usually on just enough product backlog items to fill the next sprint or two

12
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,210
this just-in-time product backlog refinement

13
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:25,010
eliminates the waste that is possible when trying to provide clarity and detail for every known item long before it is pulled into a sprint

14
00:01:26,914 --> 00:01:31,215
the product owner and development team collaboratively refined the product backlog

15
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:38,527
however product backlog items can be updated at any time by the product owner or at the product owners discretion

16
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,282
the development team is responsible for providing estimates

17
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:48,552
product backlog refinement is an ongoing activity throughout the life of a product backlog

18
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,498
since there is no gap between Sprints

19
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:54,647
product backlog refinement occurs during Sprints

20
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:59,589
and usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the development team

21
00:02:00,284 --> 00:02:06,641
scrum does not define a particular event process or time box for product backlog refinement

22
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:10,180
so the scrum team decides how and when refinement is done
