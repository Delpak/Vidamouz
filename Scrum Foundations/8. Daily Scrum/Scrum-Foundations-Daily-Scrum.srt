00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,800
in this section we'll learn all about the daily scrum meeting

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:25,240
we will cover the inputs to the meeting the goal who attends the time box the general approach to running the meeting and the output

3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,680
once a day the development team holds the daily scrum meeting

4
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,710
the goal of this meeting is to inspect and adapt the ongoing work of the Sprint

5
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,120
the time box is short 15 minutes

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,710
and so it is important for the development team to be highly focused during the meeting

7
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,880
the scrum master has three responsibilities related to the meeting

8
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,419
first the scrum master ensures that the development team has the meeting

9
00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:01,709
second the scrum master ensures that others outside of the development team do not participate

10
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:07,730
and third the scrum master teaches the development team how to keep the meeting within the 15 minute time box

11
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,530
this implies that the scrum master does not lead the meeting in a traditional sense

12
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,510
once the development team has mastered the time box and the meeting is a regular part of the team's daily work,

13
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,889
the scrum master may choose not to attend

14
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:27,090
or may choose to attend in a purely neutral and facilitative role

15
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,209
the daily scrum meeting is typically held at the same time in place each day to reduce complexity

16
00:01:36,609 --> 00:01:42,910
during the meeting members of the development team explain their progress and plans in three areas

17
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,859
what did i do yesterday to help the development team meet the Sprint goal?

18
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,730
what will I do today to help the development team meet the Sprint goal?

19
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,270
do I see any impediment that prevents me or the development team from meeting the Sprint goal?

20
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,930
the inputs to the meeting then are the Sprint goal

21
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,580
and the Sprint backlog

22
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,610
which is the development teams plan for how they will achieve the Sprint goal

23
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,860
to maintain the time box the daily scrum is focused on the transparency

24
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,330
and inspect portions of the empirical process

25
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:26,100
it is critical that the entire development team is present to reach that shared understanding

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,720
the adapt portion very often requires the input of only a subset of the development team

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,840
those involved with the portions of work that need to be adapted that day to meet the Sprint goal

28
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,710
for this reason

29
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,170
it is common for some set of the development team to meet directly after the daily scrum has concluded

30
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:50,859
they discuss how to self organize around any issues that were raised

31
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,170
adapting the affected portions of the sprint backlog

32
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,580
the adapted sprint backlog is the primary output of the daily scrum meeting

33
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,130
effective daily scrum meetings have several benefits

34
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,110
they improve communication

35
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,350
they eliminate the need for other meetings

36
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,940
they identify impediments to development for removal

37
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,869
they highlight and promote quick decision-making

38
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:25,349
and they improve the development teams level of knowledge

39
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:29,812
research has shown that effective daily scrum meetings

40
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:34,340
have a high correlation with successful implementation of the scrum framework
