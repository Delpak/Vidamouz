1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,163
the product backlog is the scrum artifact

2
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:12,360
that answers the question what is most important to build next

3
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:17,861
the primary problem of economics applied to product and service development

4
00:00:18,161 --> 00:00:21,624
is that stakeholders have seemingly unlimited wants

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,677
but organizations have limited means

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,690
given that problem we need to decide what order a scrum team

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,010
or group of scrum teams will address stakeholder desires

8
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:37,883
the product backlog is an ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product

9
00:00:38,996 --> 00:00:42,242
it makes priorities transparent to all stakeholders

10
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,665
the product owner is the scrum team member responsible for the product backlog

11
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:49,946
including what goes in it

12
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,889
what order it is in

13
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:57,688
and ensuring that it is always available to stakeholders and the team

14
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:02,352
to provide transparency and to aid the product owner in ordering

15
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:08,447
product backlog items have a description an estimate and value

16
00:01:10,548 --> 00:01:14,338
a product backlog is a constantly evolving artifact

17
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:19,891
several sources of information can change our understanding of what should be built next

18
00:01:20,024 --> 00:01:27,927
including but not limited to feedback on a completed product increment at a sprint review meeting

19
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:33,368
feedback and ideas from current and potential users and customers

20
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:36,803
ideas from internal stakeholders

21
00:01:37,076 --> 00:01:42,981
including the development team and emerging competitive and technical opportunities

22
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:48,354
multiple scrum teams often work together on the same product

23
00:01:48,622 --> 00:01:53,453
one product backlog is still used to describe the upcoming work on the product

24
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:58,351
a product backlog attribute that groups items may then be employed

25
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,321
with the dynamic nature of product  development

26
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:05,806
the product backlog is constantly being updated and refined

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,683
this is a scrum team activity led by the product owner

28
00:02:10,144 --> 00:02:14,647
product backlog refinement will be described in more detail in another video
