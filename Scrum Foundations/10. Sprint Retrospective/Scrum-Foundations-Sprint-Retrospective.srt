1
00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:08,836
In this section , we'll learn about the sprint retrospective meeting

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,360
we will cover the goal

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,270
Who attends

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,290
The time box

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,260
An the general approach to running the meeting

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,220
the sprint retrospective meeting is the final event of the sprint ,

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,530
held after the sprint review meeting

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,050
the sprint retrospective is one of the most important parts of scrum

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,617
When done well it enables the scrum team to continuously improve their approach to their work

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,220
sprint after sprint

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,990
The goal of the meeting is to inspect and adapt the scrum teams approach to their work

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,220
And all members of the scrum team attend

13
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,990
The time box for the sprint is three hours for a one month sprint

14
00:00:51,575 --> 00:00:54,675
For shorter sprints , the time box is typically shorter

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,110
There are many effective patterns to approach running the sprint retrospective meeting

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,650
Three elements are common across most of these patterns

17
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:08,738
First , the team inspects how the work was completed in the last sprint ,

18
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,960
Focusing on areas such as :

19
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:12,198
people

20
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,210
Relationships

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,220
Process

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,810
And tools

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,840
Next the attendees have a collaborative discussion to identify and order major items that went well

24
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,560
And , opportunities for improvement

25
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,930
Finally , the team creates a plan for how they will roll out any chosen improvements

26
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,950
The plan should be specific so that improvements are actually carried out in the next sprint

27
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,090
A planned improvement that is not carried out , does not help the team

28
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:50,430
Teams that are new to scrum often focus largely on improvements within the team itself

29
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,920
As improvements are made over multiple sprints ,

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,420
the scrum team reaches a level of internal effectiveness

31
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,080
Such that the largest opportunities for improvement ,

32
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:05,640
shift to how the scrum team interacts with the broader organizational system

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,100
By constantly focusing sprint after sprint on the largest opportunities to improve ,

34
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,910
effective scrum teams have a larger and larger impact on the effectiveness of the overall organization
