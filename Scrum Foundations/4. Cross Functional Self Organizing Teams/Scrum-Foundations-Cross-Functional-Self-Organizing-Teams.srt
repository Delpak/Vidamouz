1
00:00:05,377 --> 00:00:09,523
Scrum teams are self-organizing and cross-functional

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:13,293
these characteristics are often misunderstood

3
00:00:13,642 --> 00:00:17,261
so let's talk about what they mean in the context of Scrum

4
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:20,515
a Scrum team is self-organizing

5
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:24,497
meaning that the team chooses how best to accomplish their work

6
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:28,518
rather than being directed by others outside the team

7
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:35,624
within the Scrum framework, the team has total autonomy to choose how things get done

8
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:38,759
how do you estimate in Scrum?

9
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:40,355
ask the team!

10
00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:44,156
what technical practices should be used?

11
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:45,863
ask the team!

12
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:49,394
what tools should we use to track our work?

13
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:51,537
ask the team!

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,069
how is work distributed during the sprint?

15
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:56,621
ask the team!

16
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:01,085
the traditional approach to organizing teams

17
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,678
is to do so by skillset or job title

18
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:07,593
for example, all of the researchers might be on one team,

19
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:09,631
sales on another,

20
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:11,110
engineeing another,

21
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:13,783
and marketing on yet another team

22
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:17,348
this structure results in a relay race approach

23
00:01:17,432 --> 00:01:19,490
to delivering new products and services

24
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:21,323
which impedes speed,

25
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,363
flexibility, and quality

26
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:27,394
instead, Scrum teams are cross-functional

27
00:01:27,636 --> 00:01:29,787
meaning that the members of the team

28
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:33,231
have all competencies needed to accomplish the work

29
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:36,634
without depending on others not part of the team
