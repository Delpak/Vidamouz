1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,240
The team is an extremely important concept in scrum

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,119
so let's start with the definition of that term

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,430
at the highest level

4
00:00:14,527 --> 00:00:16,904
a team is any group of individuals

5
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:22,142
that work independently and collaboratively to accomplish a shared goal

6
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:26,884
let's delve into some of the key characteristics of a successful team ,

7
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:30,952
as defined by the great team expert J.Richard Hackman

8
00:00:32,357 --> 00:00:36,746
the first characteristic is something that Hackman called a real team

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,630
Successful teams have clear membership boundaries ,

10
00:00:41,044 --> 00:00:43,015
interdependence among the members ,

11
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:46,990
and at least moderate stability of membership over time

12
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:51,275
The second characteristic is compelling direction

13
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:54,609
Successful teams , have a compelling direction.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,130
a purpose that is clear , challenging and consequential

15
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,386
and that focuses on the ends to be achieved

16
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:06,196
rather than the means the team must use in persuing them

17
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:10,680
Third is enabling structure

18
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:15,538
Successful teams have structures , tasks , composition ,

19
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:21,066
and core norms of conduct that enable rather than impede teamwork

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,120
Fourth , supportive context

21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,680
Successful teams have structures and systems around them

22
00:01:29,809 --> 00:01:32,148
that provide the resources and support

23
00:01:32,253 --> 00:01:34,966
that members need to carry out their collective work

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,580
And fifth , competent coaching

25
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,480
Successful teams have competent coaching available

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,730
to help members get over rough spots

27
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:47,791
and take advantage of emerging opportunities

28
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,067
That coaching is provided at times in the team lifecycle ,

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,810
when members are most ready to receive and use it

30
00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:59,974
If we take any of these characteristics away ,

31
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:02,632
the team starts to struggle to be effective

32
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,150
Scrum supports each one of this characteristics

33
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:11,799
First , Scrum asks organizations to creat real teams

34
00:02:12,005 --> 00:02:15,212
by clearly defining team membership and roles

35
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:21,542
Second , the product backlog , product owner role and sprint goals ,

36
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:25,502
all help provide compelling direction for the scrum team

37
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:32,950
Third , Scrum is itself a set of enabling structures for how to do work within a team

38
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:38,855
Fourth , the role of management in an organization using scrum ,

39
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,840
shifts to providing supportive context for the scrum team

40
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:45,834
by removing organizational impediments

41
00:02:47,136 --> 00:02:50,363
And fifth , the scrum master role is created

42
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:53,564
to provide ongoing competent coaching to the team

43
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:58,696
Scrum also specifies two characteristics for scrum teams :

44
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:02,122
Self organization and cross functionality

45
00:03:02,636 --> 00:03:06,369
We will explore these two concepts later in this section
