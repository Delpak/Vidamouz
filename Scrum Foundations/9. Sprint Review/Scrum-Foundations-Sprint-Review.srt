00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:08,789
in this section we'll learn all about the Sprint review meeting

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,320
we will cover the input to the meeting

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,140
the goal

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,180
who attends

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,200
the time box

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,760
the general approach to running the meeting

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,740
and the output

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,740
the Sprint review meeting is held at the end of the Sprint

9
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:33,829
the primary input is the increment developed during the sprint

10
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:41,460
the goal of the meeting is to inspect that product increment and adapt the product backlog as needed

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,112
the attendees of the meeting are the scrum team

12
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:50,070
and any stakeholders invited to attend by the product owner

13
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,360
the time box for the Sprint review meeting is four hours for a one-month sprint

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,750
for shorter sprints the time box is typically shorter

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,860
and in practice most sprint planning meetings are completed well before the time box expires

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,500
the approach to the meeting is focused around three key areas

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,140
first the team demonstrates the product increment developed during the Sprint

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,279
the team answers any questions that might arise about the demonstrated increment

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,890
next the attendees have a collaborative discussion of the business context for the product

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,360
including any new developments in the marketplace, feedback from users ,

21
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,520
projected release dates if applicable and any other relevant details

22
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,570
that help the team decide what would be the most valuable thing to work on next

23
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,800
finally the product backlog is adapted based on the discussion

24
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,490
so that the scrum team enters the next sprint

25
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,990
with a shared understanding of the priority and context of their work

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,440
the output of the Sprint review then is a revised product backlog

27
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,600
that defines the probable product backlog items for the next sprint

28
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:11,310
some people incorrectly refer to the Sprint review as the sprint demo

29
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,330
notice that the demonstration of the working product increment is only a small portion of the sprint review meeting

30
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,750
while it covers an important aspect of the inspect step of an empirical process,

31
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,630
a demonstration alone does not cover the important adapt step of the Sprint review meeting
