00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,310
as we learned in a previous section
scrum is an empirical approach to managing work

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,940
that means that each of
the scrum events is meant to increase transparency

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:21,610
so that the team can
reliably inspect their progress and adapt their plans to better reach a
desired outcome

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,350
in this section we'll get an overview of how all of the scrum
events work together as a system

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:34,820
in future sections we'll take a closer look
at each event covering the why who and how in more detail

6
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:38,110
the Sprint is the heartbeat of scrum

7
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:43,129
it can be viewed as a container for all of scrums inspect and adapt loops

8
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:47,660
the scrum team delivers a new iteration of the working product
every sprint

9
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,650
each sprint lasts at most one calendar month and shorter sprints
are extremely common

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:04,130
at the beginning of
the sprint the scrum team comes together in the sprint planning meeting to assess
which items from the top of the product backlog they can pull into the sprint

11
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,220
the team crafts a sprint goal a high-level objective that will be
accomplished by delivering the selected product backlog items

12
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,219
the Sprint goal helps ensure a shared understanding of the purpose of the work in the coming
Sprint

13
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:22,459
they then create the sprint backlog which is the development teams
plan for how they will deliver the new product increment,

14
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:29,290
once sprint planning is complete the development team begins their development work which continues
until the end of the sprint

15
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:37,459
once a day they will meet together at
the daily scrum meeting to inspect the
sprint plan and make any adaptations necessary

16
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,940
when the Sprint is complete
they will deliver a releasable product increment

17
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,950
they inspect that increment
along with other stakeholders at the sprint review meeting

18
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,230
and adapt their
future plans for the product by updating the product backlog

19
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,910
finally the scrum
team will hold a sprint retrospective to inspect the system of work itself

20
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:00,520
and make adaptations to be more effective in future sprints

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,459
scrum teams should have consistent
sprint lengths

22
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:10,340
Sprint's provide a rhythm to the work of the team and the business

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,110
instead of adjusting the length of each sprint to match the upcoming work in the
product backlog,

24
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,280
effective scrum teams learned to refine product backlog items
such that several could fit in any given sprint

25
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,870
the maximum sprint length is one calendar month

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,800
and the majority of scrum teams today used two week sprints
providing twice as many opportunities to inspect and adapt over time

27
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:35,030
no new work can be pushed into the sprint

28
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,460
in scrum the only way for work to be part of a
sprint is for the development team to
pull it in

29
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,160
as discussed earlier this is one of the primary purposes of the
sprint planning meeting

30
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:53,160
if a development team finds that they
have additional capacity while the Sprint is in progress they may choose to
pull additional work into the sprint

31
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,449
at all times meeting the Sprint goal is the guiding principle

32
00:02:58,749 --> 00:03:04,270
if as is more common the work turns out to be different than the
development team expected,

33
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,619
they collaborate with the product owner to
negotiate the scope of Sprint backlog within the Sprint

34
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,510
the product owner may
choose to cancel a sprint

35
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:22,890
this might happen if for example the Sprint goal
becomes obsolete market conditions change or the company makes a major
strategy change

36
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,550
sprint cancellations are rare since Sprint's are intentionally
short
