1
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:11,227
for an individual team or organization to realize the benefits of scrum

2
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:16,825
the structural components of the framework  are an important but incomplete factor

3
00:00:17,347 --> 00:00:22,375
the components of the framework are the visible logical system of scrum

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,148
since scrum is meant to be used by people

5
00:00:25,148 --> 00:00:29,860
who have complex varied beliefs and values that influence their behavior

6
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:34,477
it is important to describe the values that make the system work in practice

7
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:38,509
the components of the framework are like the brain of scrum

8
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:49,679
the five scrum values commitment courage focus openness and respect are like the heart of scrum

9
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:53,923
commitment literally means joined together

10
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:58,165
it involves sharing our sincere intent to act

11
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:04,095
and then accepting responsibility for following through on that intended action

12
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:10,613
in scrum people personally commit to achieving the shared goals of the scrum team

13
00:01:11,986 --> 00:01:14,697
courage means from the heart

14
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,750
it involves acting in alignment with our beliefs especially when that is hard

15
00:01:21,353 --> 00:01:24,591
scrum team members have courage to do the right thing

16
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:26,929
and work on tough problems

17
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:32,502
focus comes from the Latin word for domestic hearth

18
00:01:32,502 --> 00:01:36,443
which was the location of the fire at the center of the home

19
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:43,913
people in the home gathered around the hearth for warmth light and sustenance since it was used for cooking

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,397
the focus was literally the thing that brought people together

21
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:54,378
in scrum everyone focuses on the work of the sprint and the goals of the scrum team

22
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:59,294
openness means exposed or evident

23
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:03,996
the scrum team and its stakeholders agreed to be open about all the work

24
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,762
and the challenges with performing the work

25
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,965
openness is closely related to the empirical pillar of transparency

26
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:16,755
respect means to look or view again

27
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:21,175
respect involves taking a second look at how we view others

28
00:02:21,286 --> 00:02:26,647
to develop a sincere appreciation for the unique capabilities that they contribute

29
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:32,045
scrum team members respect each other to be capable independent people

30
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:37,513
when these five values are embodied and lived by the scrum team

31
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:43,291
the structures become far more effective at their intended goal of empirical improvement

32
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:49,263
at the same time the structures are designed to encourage the development of the values

33
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:51,809
giving meaning and depth to the work

34
00:02:51,944 --> 00:02:58,142
successful use of scrum depends on people developing a greater awareness and proficiency

35
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:05,135
at both the intelligence represented by the structural framework and the intension represented by the five values

36
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:10,438
both are important areas for inspection and adaptation by a scrum team
