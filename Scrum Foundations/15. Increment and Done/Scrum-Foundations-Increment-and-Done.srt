1
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:10,101
an increment broadly defined is an increase or addition

2
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:15,339
especially when that addition represents one of several steps in a sequence

3
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,142
in scrum the development team works to deliver a new increment of the product every sprint

4
00:00:22,635 --> 00:00:27,361
each increment is a new updated usable version of the product

5
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,629
so the product owner may choose to immediately release it

6
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:36,547
a product increment is a tangible output of each and every sprint

7
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:42,823
the increment is considered done if it can be immediately released without any additional work

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,590
each increment is additive to all prior increments and

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,790
is thoroughly tested ensuring that all increments work together

10
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:59,124
in order to assess when work is complete on a product backlog item or an increment

11
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,082
the scrum team creates a shared definition of done

12
00:01:04,443 --> 00:01:11,860
this definition provides transparency about the level of quality that is considered sufficient to release an increment

13
00:01:13,912 --> 00:01:20,803
the definition of done guides the development team in knowing how many product backlog items to selecting sprint planning

14
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:26,870
since the purpose of each sprint is to deliver increments of potentially releasable functionality

15
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,429
that adhere to the scrum teams current definition of done

16
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:35,257
this definition will vary significantly per scrum team

17
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:40,394
since each team collaboratively creates it based on their own context and goals

18
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:45,773
when multiple scrum teams work on the same system or product release

19
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:52,883
they collaborate to create a shared minimum definition of done to which all teams will adhere
