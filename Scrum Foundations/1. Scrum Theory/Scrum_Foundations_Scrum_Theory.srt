00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,270
this definition is from the "SCRUM GUIDE"

2
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:20,350
the official document created and regulary updated by Scrum's co-creators:

3
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,740
Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schweiber

4
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:25,870
in this video, we will explain that definition

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,930
and describe the underlying theory of Scrum

6
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:36,560
Scrum is described as a process framework rather than a complete process for building products

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,750
one important distinction is that Scrum is intentionally incomplete

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,880
it does not specify all of the steps required to build a product

9
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:54,460
instead, It describes the framework within which a variety of processes and techniques can be deployed

10
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,450
the Scrum framework consists of Scrum teams

11
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:03,140
and their associated roles

12
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,660
events

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,080
and artifacts

14
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,140
each of these core-components has a few rules

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,760
and there are simple rules describing the relationship and interaction between the components

16
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:29,440
anything not described by those components and rules is not part of the framework

17
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:36,530
the Scrum team decides which processes and techniques to use within the framework

18
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:44,406
if the team orthe organization were to decide to remove or alter any of the components or their rules

19
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:46,870
they are no longer using Scrum

20
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,840
Scrum exists only in it's entirety

21
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,150
and each of the core-components and their associated rules serves a specific purpose

22
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:03,450
the second part of the definition, describes something called a "Complex Adaptive Problem"

23
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,530
to understand that, let's look at a spectrum

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:16,780
on one end of the spectrum we will place problems that are simple,predictable and static... or unchanging

25
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:25,830
on the other end, we will place problems that are complex, unpredictable and adaptive... or always changing

26
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,330
most professionals are familiar with how to address problems at the left end of this spectrum

27
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,130
since these are predictable problems, we are able to create a detailed plan

28
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,120
the plan might have many steps and dependencies

29
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:50,730
but, if the system is predictable, the plan will progress without any surprises or the need to change things along the way

30
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,873
this approach is known as "Defined Process Control"

31
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,700
which means that we define a specific process for every step along the way

32
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,790
this works well when things are predictable

33
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,680
when things are more complex and unpredictable

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,020
this approach is not very effective

35
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,190
one of the most frequently cited books on this topic is called:

36
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,400
process dynamics,modeling and control

37
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,370
by Babatunde A. Ogunnaike and W. Harman Ray

38
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,140
in this book the authors explain:

39
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,790
It is typical to adopt a defined approach

40
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:31,030
when underlying mechanisms by which a process operates are resonably well understood

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,640
when the process is too complicated for the defined approach, the empirical approach is the appropriate choice

42
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:46,290
Ogunnaike and Ray are telling us that the defined approach doesn't work when things are complex and adaptive

43
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,350
and that we should instead use something called:

44
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:51,450
Empirical Process Control

45
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,140
so let's explore what that means

46
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,490
an empirical approach is one that is based on observations and evidence

47
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,450
empiricism is the central idea behinde the scientific method

48
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,910
that we can find out what is true through experiments with concrete observable results

49
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,790
in order to make good observations, an empirical process has three pillars

50
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,010
transparency

51
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,090
inspection

52
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,620
and adaptation

53
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,810
Scrum is based on empirical process control

54
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:34,390
and so significant aspects of Scrum are designed to provide transparency,inspection and adaptation

55
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:43,440
to creat transparency, Scrums events and artifacts are visible to all of those responsible for their outcomes

56
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,763
organizations using Scrums, frequently inspect Scrum artifacts

57
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:50,781
and progress towards a sprint goal

58
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,480
to detect undesirable variances

59
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,280
they balance the frequency of the inspection, so it doesn't get in the way of the work

60
00:04:58,412 --> 00:05:02,370
but still provides sufficient opportunities to course-correct

61
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,910
if during inspections, anything is determined to be outside of the goals of the effort,

62
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,640
the process,plans or product are adapted

63
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,640
the adaptation is made  as son as possible to optimize for a better outcome

64
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,393
to summarize:

65
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:23,600
Scrum is a lightweigh framework

66
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:31,390
made up of a few roles, events,artifacts and their rules that is simple to understand

67
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,140
however, since it relies on empirical process control to address complex adaptive problems,

68
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,960
it is difficult to master
