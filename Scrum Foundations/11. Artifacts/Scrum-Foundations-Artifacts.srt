1
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:07,841
in archaeology, the term artifact

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,523
refers to an object that was made by a human

3
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:16,106
the Latin roots of the world artifact roughly translate to:

4
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:17,417
work of art

5
00:00:18,288 --> 00:00:21,640
so, an artifact is something that we make

6
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:24,308
either a tool that solves a problem

7
00:00:24,762 --> 00:00:26,979
or a work of art that inspires

8
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:31,963
Scrum describes 3 primary artifacts

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,900
the product backlog

10
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:35,861
the sprint backlog

11
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:38,036
and the product increment

12
00:00:39,387 --> 00:00:43,363
the product backlog and sprint backlog describe work to be done

13
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:44,792
that would add value

14
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:48,497
and the product increment is the done portion of the product

15
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,338
completed during a sprint

16
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:55,342
the theree Scrum artifacts share the same goals

17
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:58,217
to maximize transparency

18
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:02,373
and promote a shared understanding of the work

19
00:01:04,383 --> 00:01:05,837
the product backlog,

20
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:10,535
is the ordered list of everything we might want the development team to work on

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,942
related to the product under development

22
00:01:14,098 --> 00:01:16,466
having a single ordered list

23
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:19,345
makes organizational priorities transparent

24
00:01:19,485 --> 00:01:21,963
to all internal stakeholders of the product

25
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,749
a single product owner is responsible for the ordering of the product backlog

26
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,956
which provides transparency to the organization

27
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:34,623
about the decision making process used to arrive at the order

28
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,990
the product backlog is the dynamic artifact

29
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,619
meaning that it is constantly evolving

30
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:44,460
based on what is known at a given point in time

31
00:01:45,403 --> 00:01:47,984
the product owner collaborates with the development team

32
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:49,810
to refine the product backlog

33
00:01:50,832 --> 00:01:53,720
product backlog refinement is an ongoing activity

34
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:57,563
that can require up to 10 percent of the development teams time

35
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:02,926
this dynamic, ongoing, and collaborative refinement of the product backlog,

36
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,601
promotes a shared understanding of the work

37
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:11,649
the sprint backlog is collaboratively created during sprint planning

38
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:13,093
by the development team

39
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:16,847
it is their plan for how they will deliver the sprint  goal

40
00:02:16,952 --> 00:02:20,116
and related product backlog items during the current sprint

41
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,826
it is regularly updated throughout the sprint

42
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:25,810
as the development team learns more

43
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:31,212
it is a transparent, real-time picture of all of the work in the current sprint

44
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,847
the product increment is the sum of all completed product backlog items

45
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:39,370
in a given sprint

46
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:42,148
plus the value of previous increments

47
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:47,193
the product increment provides an accurate, transparent picture

48
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:50,177
of the state of the product at the end of each sprint

49
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:54,497
it helps Scrum teams realize the agile principle

50
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:58,228
that working software is the primary measure of progress

51
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:03,180
which can be refrased as working product is the primary measure  of progress

52
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:05,132
for nonsoftware uses of Scrum

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,307
since the product increment, meets the team's definition of done

54
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:12,482
it is usable by stakeholders

55
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:16,767
providing an opportunity for inspection of the current state of the product

56
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:19,101
to the extent

57
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:21,958
that Scrum artifacts are completely transparent

58
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:23,894
and have shared understanding

59
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:27,497
good decisions can be made through inspecting and adapting

60
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:32,094
incomplete transparency can lead to flawd decisions,

61
00:03:32,456 --> 00:03:33,840
reduced value delivery,

62
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,348
and increased risk

63
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:37,031
for this reason

64
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:42,492
the Scrum master focuses on increasing transparency of the Scrum artifacts
