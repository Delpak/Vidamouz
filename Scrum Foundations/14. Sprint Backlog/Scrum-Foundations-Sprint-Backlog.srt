1
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:09,067
during sprint planning the scrum team creates two outputs

2
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:12,703
the Sprint goal and the sprint backlog

3
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:16,487
the Sprint goal is  a high level objective

4
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:21,412
that provides guidance to the development team on why the work of that sprint is importan t

5
00:00:21,757 --> 00:00:23,946
it could be a customer outcome

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,720
a business impact

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,330
a learning goal

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,560
a risk reduction objective

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,710
or anything else that helps the development team work cohesively towards a shared goal

10
00:00:35,186 --> 00:00:38,105
rather than on separate initiatives during the Sprint

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:46,340
the Sprint backlog can be thought of as having two components the what of the Sprint and the how of the Sprint

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:54,320
during sprint planning the development team pulls the highest ordered items from the p roduct backlog into the sprint backlog

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:02,602
they pull items into the sprint as they forecast can be delivered into a done increment within the sprint time box

14
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:07,594
the completion of these items enables the team to reach the Sprint goal

15
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:16,089
notice that pulling these items into the Sprint will usually create the need to do further product backlog refinement during the Sprint

16
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:19,934
so that there are sufficient ready items for the next sprint planning

17
00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:29,098
the Sprint backlog also contains the development teams plan for how they will deliver the product increment and realize the Sprint goal

18
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:36,866
the Sprint backlog makes visible all of the work that the development team identifies as  necessary to meet the Sprint goal

19
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:45,141
the Sprint backlog should provide enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the daily scrum

20
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:51,036
the development team modifies the Sprint backlog throughout the Sprint as they work through the plan

21
00:01:51,036 --> 00:01:54,472
and learn more about the work needed to achieve the Sprint goal

22
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,363
potential modifications to the Sprint backlog during the Sprint may include

23
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:02,903
adding newly discovered work needed to meet the Sprint goal

24
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:07,685
updating estimates on the amount of work remaining to reach the Sprint goal

25
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:12,121
and removing elements of the plan that are discovered to be unnecessary

26
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:17,221
only the development team can change its Sprint backlog during a sprint

27
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:24,571
the Sprint backlog is a highly visible real-time picture of the work that the development team plans to accomplish during the sprint

28
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:27,423
and it belongs solely to the development team
