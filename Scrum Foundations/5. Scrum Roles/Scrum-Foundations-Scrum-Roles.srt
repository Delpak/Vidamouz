1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,290
scrum defines three roles within the
scrum team

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,150
the product owner, the development team and the scrum master

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,170
the product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and
the work of the development team

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:28,110
one of the primary ways the product owner
manages this work is through the product backlog

5
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:35,090
the product owner is accountable
for the order of the items in the product backlog

6
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,260
for ensuring that the
items are clearly understood

7
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,740
and that the product backlog is transparent to
the scrum team and other stakeholders in
the organization

8
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,030
the product owner can choose whether to manage the product
backlog on their own

9
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:59,779
or to involve the development team in the work however the
product owner remains accountable

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,710
the development team is responsible for
building the actual product increment

11
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,910
in this work the development team is
cross-functional & self-organizing and

12
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:18,540
while individuals often have specialized
skills or areas of focus

13
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,090
accountability belongs to the team as a whole

14
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,160
development teams tend to have between 3 and 9 team members

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,200
smaller than three may result in a skill gap that makes it difficult

16
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,720
to deliver potentially releasable increments during a sprint

17
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:46,120
larger than nine results in a level of
complexity that makes coordination self-organization and empirical
management difficult

18
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:55,259
the scrum master is responsible for ensuring that scrum is
understood and used skillfully by the scrum team

19
00:01:55,559 --> 00:02:02,959
scrum masters do this by
acting as a guide to the organization on scrum theory practices and rules

20
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:08,749
the scrum master is often described as a servant leader role

21
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:14,140
this description means that the scrum master leads by
helping rather than coercing

22
00:02:14,579 --> 00:02:21,210
it can also be viewed as a role that
serves through modeling and agile mindset and skillful use of the scrum
framework

23
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:28,960
the scrum master ensures that the product owner development team and
organization as a whole

24
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,290
understand how scrum can be used to help them accomplish and align their goals
