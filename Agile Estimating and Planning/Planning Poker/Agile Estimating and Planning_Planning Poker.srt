00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,620
п«пе 
so let's talk about how to pull all these ideas together 

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,620
into an estimating approach that works

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,460
 the technique is called planning poker

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,500
 and it's loosely based on the Delphi and Wideband Delphi approaches

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,560
 the date back to the RAND Corporation in the 1940s

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,180
 in planning poker each estimator which should be everybody on the team 

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,440
is holding a set of cards that contain the numbers the team has agreed to use as their estimates 

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,620
normally this will be the modified Fibonacci sequence

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,260
but that's really up to the team 

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,260
the product owner reads a product backlog item usually a user story to the team

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,840
the team in the product owner discussed the item team

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,800
team members asked questions

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,280
the product owner clarifies expectations

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,100
this can be as short as a few seconds
but it can take as long as needed

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,660
once each team member has decided upon an estimate

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,840
they pulled that card out of their hand 

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,900
holding it so no one else can see it

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,700
when everyone has picked an estimate

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,220
the cards are revealed all at the same time

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,280
if everyone is holding up the same number we're done

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,240
write that number down as the estimate and move on

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,640
but if the numbers are different 

23
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,120
we discuss it and an estimated again 

24
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,580
let's see an example

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,800
during the first round our estimators hold up a 3, 8 a 2 and a 5 

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,780
at this point I really want to hear from the others

27
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,620
 why 8 why 2?

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,080
 anybody can talk 

29
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,580
but in this case I would really want to hear from Vadim and Ann 

30
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:35,260
buddy might say well I'm the tester on this project and this is going to be really hard to test

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,320
 I need to build a new test framework and so on

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,860
Ann says well Vadim is right 

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,560
my two is too low I'm going to come up

34
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,100
 but I've programmed this type of thing before and it's not that hard

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,080
 so I'm coming up but not all the way to a 8

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,320
anyone can talk at this point

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,220
but I especially want to hear from the outliers

38
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,120
after anyone who wants to has had a chance to talk 

39
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,900
each team member again picks a number from the cards in their hands

40
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,600
 and then all at once the cards are revealed

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,540
this time let's say we get three fives in an eighth

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,420
 at this point I'd ask Chris with his 8

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,880
 to give us an impassioned plea for why 8 is the right estimate

44
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,100
I was with a team a little while ago

45
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,640
that had all weights except for 1 13

46
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,900
I asked the guy with a 13 why

47
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,780
boom boom boom he gave three good reasons why he thought it was a 13 

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,060
and on the next round everyone switched to agree with him

49
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,080
so notice this isn't a vote

50
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,100
 we don't say that the majority rules in pick a 5

51
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,440
we keep going until we get to a consensus

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,960
the consensus may be a little false

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,880
but that's okay 

54
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,960
suppose we go another two or three rounds with Chris holding up an 8

55
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,620
while the rest of us have 5s

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,880
 at that point I'd probably ask Chris if he thinks we've heard his arguments

57
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,380
but that we just disagree

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,040
 if he does think we've heard him he will eventually fold and hold up a 5

59
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,880
 I'm ok with Chris folding

60
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,660
 after all the difference between 8 and 5 isn't that great 

61
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,320
and we're pretty far up the effort accuracy curve

62
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,860
we saw a few minutes ago

63
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,080
 now if Chris had been holding up a 100 instead of an 8

64
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,480
I wouldn't want him to fold

65
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,220
 if we're that far apart we're probably facing one of two problems

66
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,680
one product uncertainty 

67
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,260
which is the product owner saying something like
good question

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,520
I better run that by some users it could go either way

69
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,640
 or to

70
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,120
technical uncertainty

71
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,360
which is when the team thinks that doing the user story will be easy

72
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,920
if they use one particular technical approach but hard if they take another approach 

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,580
so whether its product uncertainty or technical uncertainty

74
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,640
 if the estimates are hopelessly far apart put the story aside 

75
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,880
do the research and then estimate the user story next week or whenever you get together again

76
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,380
or consider using a range if reducing the uncertainty will take more effort than you want to

77
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,080
 or can invest

78
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,440
 if team members ask the product owner what type of bear koala bear or grizzly bear

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,240
and the product owner can't say

80
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,460
your best option is to write down five to a hundred

81
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,540
one challenge with relative estimating is
 how to get started 

82
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,440
my recommendation is for team members to look at the product backlog

83
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,700
and find something they want to call a 2

84
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,920
 don't play planning poker quite yet just find it 2

85
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,400
something small but not the smallest

86
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,960
 I don't want you to waste time doing a bubble sort on your product backlog

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,580
looking for the smallest item

88
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,160
instead someone on the team to one user story and says that one's it 2

89
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,040
team members can argue if they disagree

90
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,620
but they keep at it until the team finds one user story

91
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,440
that everyone can agree is a 2

92
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,460
then look for a 5

93
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,040
remember we're only really good across one order of magnitude

94
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,320
so finding a 2 and a 5 establishes us a good baseline across most of that order of magnitude

95
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,860
I don't really care if you find a 2 and a 5

96
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,380
maybe you find a 1 and a 5 or a 2 and 8
any of those is fine

97
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,440
 the idea is just to get a pair of numbers that everyone agrees on

98
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,620
and then start playing planning poker

99
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,380
I want to mention briefly that if you're looking for planning poker cards

100
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:14,380
we do sell the cards at our cost on our website at store mountaingoatsoftware.com

101
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,300
also we have a free website you can use for playing planning poker with a distributed team

102
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,849
in the next video we will look at some of the reasons why planning poker works
