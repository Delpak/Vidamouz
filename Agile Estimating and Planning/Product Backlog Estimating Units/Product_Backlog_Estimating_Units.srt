1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,980
in this module we're going to move up a level to release planning

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,980
and take a look at how we estimate the product backlog

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,570
remember that the product backlog is a repository of everything

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:20,360
the product owner would like to have created over the life of the project

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,560
most teams tend to write their product backlog in the form of user stories

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,820
short simple statements told from the perspective of a user as I've shown here

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,760
throughout this module we're going to look at two different units

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,440
that agile teams commonly use for estimating their product backlogs

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,180
story points  and ideal days

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,060
we'll discuss the merits of each and by the end of this next set of videos

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,720
you'll have decided which unit you prefer

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,560
if you already have a preference by the end of this module

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,100
you'll be prepared with additional arguments in favor of that preference

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,300
think of it as a debate between the metric system and the English system

15
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,120
that is should we measure distance in kilometers or miles

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,780
that's what we'll be deciding in this module

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,840
before we really jump into things

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,380
I want to ask you to do a short exercise

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,600
I'd like you to estimate two things for me

20
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,340
first

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,860
tell me how long it will take to read the final Harry Potter book

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,300
you can see it here in this box to set

23
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,940
next estimate how long it will take you to drive from where you are to someplace pretty far away

24
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,340
since I don't know where you are I can't pick that place

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,400
pick a destination yourself that's pretty far

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,920
probably not somewhere you can drive in a day

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,960
and not somewhere you drive frequently

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,340
I'm here in Denver Colorado right now

29
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,560
I might pick some place like Detroit

30
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,000
as you do this don't cheat and look up on the internet how many pages the Harry Potter book is

31
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,380
or how many miles or kilometers away your destination is

32
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,080
I'm not really interested in their real numbers

33
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,100
and besides it's not like I'm going to ask you what your estimates are

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,620
but I do want you to pause this presentation and estimate these two things

35
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,140
the goal is to learn something about how we estimate real-world work

36
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,460
our goal isn't to come up with perfect estimates right now

37
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:17,120
okay pause this video now and restart it once you've estimated drive and reading of the seventh Harry Potter book

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,240
let me guess at some of the ways you might have estimated these two activities

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,000
one thing you might have done is compared to the thing being estimated to some other thing

40
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,700
you might for example have looked at the last Harry Potter book

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,600
and thought it was similar to the previous book the thick green one here

42
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,140
but a little longer

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,980
so you tried to recall how long it took you to read the sixth book

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,400
and then increase that amount by a little to come up with your estimate

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,380
this is called estimation by analogy and it's a great way to estimate

46
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,660
estimating by analogy is an important technique

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,180
and when we're going to rely on here as we build up a good estimation approach

48
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,080
another technique you may have used in estimating either the driving or the reading

49
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,680
is to first think about the size of the work estimate your pace through the work

50
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,360
and then divide to come up with an estimate of the duration

51
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,600
let's see how this might have worked with Harry Potter

52
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,880
perhaps you estimated the size of the book at six hundred pages

53
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,900
you then estimated that you read say one page every minute and a half

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,820
that means 40 pages per hour

55
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,180
dividing 600 pages by 40 pages per hour gives us an estimate of 15 hours

56
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,320
this is a great way to estimate

57
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,660
you may have done it for the driving example

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,680
by thinking about how many miles or kilometers away your destination was

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,640
and then dividing that by an estimated speed per hour

60
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,420
having seen how we estimate real-world activities like driving or reading

61
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,880
in the next video

62
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:54,750
we will turn what we just learned into one of the most valuable principles of agile estimating
