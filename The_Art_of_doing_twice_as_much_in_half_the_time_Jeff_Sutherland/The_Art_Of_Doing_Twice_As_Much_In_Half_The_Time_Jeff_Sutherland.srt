00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,160
سلام. اینجا هستم تا درباره زندگی، رهایی و جستجوی شادمانی صحبت کنم
hello I'm here to talk about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,340
رویای بزرگِ آمریکایی‌ها، که اغلب محقق نشده است
a great American dream that's often not fulfilled

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,920
به قول رابرت بِرنز (شاعر اسکاتلندی - قرن ۱۷ میلادی)
in the words of the poet Robert Burns

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,460
«بهترین نقشه‌های آدمها و موشها، اغلب اوقات به شکل وحشتناکی غلط از آب در می‌آیند
"The best-laid plans of mice and men, often go terribly wrong"

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,780
و جای رسیدن به آرزو 
به درد و رنج، ختم می‌شوند»
and lead to pain and suffering
instead of the promised hope

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,240
اولین بار که با این مشکل دست و پنجه نرم کردم، زمانی بود که دانشجوی دانشکده افسری در وست پوینت  (آکادمی نظامی ایالات متحده) بودم
I first started to wrestle with this problem as a cadet at West Point (United States Military Academy)

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,260
در دوره آموزشی، رنجها و مصیبت‌های فراوانی کشیدیم
we went through a lot of pain and suffering in our training

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,820
در آخرین سال حضورم در آنجا، من را به عنوان افسر آموزش منصوب کردند
and in the last year I was there they made me the training officer

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,700
تا گروهان ال.۲ را آموزش دهم
for company L2

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,560
چون در انجام حرکات رژه مشکل داشتند
because they had a marching problem on the parade field

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,740
گروهان ال.۲ به گروهان "شل و ول‌های بی‌عرضه" معروف بود
company L2 is known as the "Loose Deuce"

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,400
چون به مدت ۱۰۰ سال
because for a hundred years

14
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,420
معمولی بودن را به مثابه یک سنت پذیرفته بودند
they had a tradition of mediocrity

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
با عملکردی بی‌نظم و شلخته
sloppy performance

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,960
ده‌ها سال افرادی سعی کردند که آنها را بیشتر آموزش دهند
for decades people had tried to get them to march longer train harder

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,520
اما هر کاری کردند، بی‌فایده بود
but nothing worked

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,140
می‌دانستم باید کار متفاوتی بکنم
so I knew I had to do something different

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,440
خب تصمیمی که گرفتم این بود ، من نمی توانستم به آنها بگویم چه کاری انجام دهند 
so what I decided to do is, I couldn't tell them what to do

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,480
اما نشانه ها و شبنماهای مشخصی برای یافتن مسیر برای آنها قرار دادم
 but I could put up in the bulletin board at night and color coded notes

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,430
نشانه های که دقیقاً نمایشگر عملکرد آنها در میدان رژه بود
 exactly how their performance was in the parade field

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,100
دقیقاً همان چیزی که آنها باید برای بهبود انجام دهند
in exactly what they needed to do to improve

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,160
برای مثال شما می دانید که چارلی باید با توقف شمشیر بر روی زمین 
you know Charlie has got to stop sticking his sword in the ground

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,920
در میان اجرای رژه
 in the middle of a parade

25
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,160
تا نشانی برای تغییر جهت در گوشه میدان برای سومین گردان بفرستد
the 3rd platoon has got to turn the corner

26
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,800
و تمامی این فعالیت ها باید در هماهنگی کامل و با دستور دقیق فرمانده انجام پذیرد
in synchronization and the commander has to enunciate his commands crisply

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,880
بدون لحظه ای درنگ یا اختلاف زمانی
 in exactly right timing

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,060
به گونه ای که همه شگفت زده شوند
 to everyone's amazement

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:54,480
در طی سه ماه این گروهان به بهترین گروهان لشکر تبدیل شد
 they became the number one  company in the Corps cadets within three months

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,140
و در همان زمان ژنرال مک آرتور درگذشت
 and General MacArthur died at this time

31
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,280
و او درخواست کرده بود تا یک گروهان از دانش آموختگان دانشکده افسری برای بدرقه تابوت او تا آرامگاهش حاضر باشند و گروهان ال.2 انتخاب شد
and he had specified there must be a company cadets marching behind his casket

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,480

 to lay him to rest, and L2 was chosen

33
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,800
برای آخرین مراسم خاکسپاری
so for dead last

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,500
برای انجام مراسم خاکسپاری یکی از بزرگترین ژنرال های (آکادمی نظامی ایالات متحده)
to putting out one of our greatest generals in the grave

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,820
یک تحول بزرگ در یک بازه زمانی بسیار کوتاه
was a long journey in a very short period of time

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,340
بعد از آن من از وست پوینت (آکادمی نظامی ایالات متحده) فارغ التحصیل شدم و به نیروی هوایی رفتم
 now I graduated from West Point and I went into the air force

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,560
در زمانی که در وست پوینت بودم من آموخته های زیادی از سایر فرماندهان داشتم
while i was at West Point I learned something from other leaders

38
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,800
من در اتاقی زندگی می کردم که روی پلاکی که روی گچ بری دور بخاری آن نصب شده بود ، نوشته بود
I lived in a room which were they had a plaque on the mantelpiece it said

39
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,060
ژنرال دوایت آیزنهاور ( سی و چهارمین رئیس جمهور ایالات متحده) اینجا می خوابیده است
general DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER slept here

40
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,480
هر زمان که این پلاک را می خواندم نقل قول معروفی از او را به یاد می آوردم که 
and every time I'd read that plaque I'd remember

41
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280

 his famous quote

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,080
"برنامه ها بی ارزش هستند اما برنامه ریزی همه چیز است"
"Plans are worthless, but planning is everything"

43
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,040
بنابراین زمانی که به عنوان یک خلبان جنگنده در تیم شناسایی بودم ، برنامه ریزی های زیادی انجام دادیم
so when I got to be a fighter pilot I was in reconnaissance we did a lot of planning

44
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,940
اما یک روز یکی از خلبانان همکار من 
 but one day one of my fellow pilots

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,780
در حین عملیات بر روی هانوی(پایتخت ویتنام) مورد اصابت یک موشک زمین به هوای سام قرار گرفت و هواپیمای او منفجر شد
 ed attebery was blown out of the air over Hanoi, by a SAM (Surface-to-Air) Missile

46
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,620
من با خودم گفتم که او برنامه ریزی بسیار خوبی داشت
 and I said to myself he did really good planning

47
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,320
ولی او عموماً بر روی هدف به صورت افقی پرواز می کرد و در نهایت اقدام به گرفتن عکس می کرد
 but he was flying straight and level over the target

48
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,900
که اینکار می تواند من را بکشتن بدهد
that could get me killed

49
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,960
از آن روز به بعد
from that day forward

50
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,260
برنامه من این بود که ببینم هدف چیست
my plan was to have a vision where the target was

51
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,380

and as soon as I crossed North Vietnam I went into an evasive maneuver

52
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,520

because every second I knew I was being fired at

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,560

and only at the last moment would i come up straight level offer a target just for a second

54
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,780

to snap that photo

55
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,480
حالا من زنده ام
now I got out of there alive

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,620
بیش از نیمی از همراهان من همچون فلوید از مأموریت خود بازنگشتند
over half the people like fluid, did not come back from their missions

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,100
و هنگامی که من به ایالات متحده برگشتم
 and when I came back to the United States

58
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,400
سورپرایز بزرگی بود چراکه من بارها به کشته شدن نزدیک شده بودم
 it was a big surprise I'd come so close to getting killed so many times

59
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,920
احساس می کردم
it felt like

60
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,570
که یک زندگی جدید به من بخشیده شده است
it was a new life.

61
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,880
هر روز برای من مثل یک هدیه ویژه بود
every day was like a bonus day

62
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,330
یک روز کامل
a free day

63
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,240
و این سؤال که من با این روز چیکار می توانستم بکنم
and what was I going to do with it

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,580
بنابراین من از نیروی هوایی خواستم تا من را به کشورم برگردانند
 so I asked the Air Force to send me back

65
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,400
به آکادمی نیروی هوایی تا به عنوان یک مدرس آموزش دیده مشغول به کار شوم
to the Air Force Academy to become a trained to be a professor

66
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,380
یا به مدرسه آموزشی در استنفورد تا به عنوان یک آموزش دیده آکادمی نیروی هوایی ایالات متحده در آنجا مشغول به کار شوم
or back to school at Stanford trained to be a professor at the Air Force Academy

67
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,360
و از آنجا به دانشکده پزشکی دانشگاه کلرادو(از ایالت های جنوب غربی امریکا) رفتم
and from there I went into the University of Colorado medical school

68
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,600
من برای مدت یازده سال در آن دانشکده بودم
I was on the faculty they for 11 years

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,380
تا زمانی که آنجا بودم
while I was there

70
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,660
تخصص من ساخت سوپر مدل های کامپیوتری با استفاده از ساختار سلول های انسانی بود
 my expertise was building super computer models of the human cell

71
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,980
و نشان دادن چگونگی تکامل آنها
and showing how it evolved

72
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,200
 and multiplied

73
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,220
and what caused it to become cancerous what could make that stop

74
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,940
how do we cure cancer

75
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,480
 and while I was there

76
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,900
 a big banking company running 150 banks all over North America came by, they said

77
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,120
you know at the University you have the best expertise in technologies we use at the bank

78
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,820
you have all the knowledge and know that none of the money

79
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,780
but at the bank we've got all the money

80
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,240
 and we don't know what we're doing

81
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,840
 you should come work for the bank and it would be a perfect marriage of knowledge and money

82
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,100
and they may be an offer that my wife couldn't refuse a poor university professor

83
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,820
so I wind up at the bank and what do I see

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,080
 I see they're running all these huge projects

85
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,500
 hundreds of developers

86
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,180
and they manage all these projects with a Gantt chart

87
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,700
and this is a technology that was introduced to the military in the United States in 1910

88
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,420
it didn't work very well in World War one

89
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,820
and it didn't work very well then

90
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,500
because every piece of the project is lined up with a date

91
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,520
and if anybody misses that timing

92
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,520
the whole project is delayed

93
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,820
and when it gets delayed the customers get upset the managers get angry

94
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,260
that would force these developers to work nights, weekends they go on death marches

95
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,100
it reminded me of the Roman galleys you know

96
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:27,060
the slaves rowing rowing the whip is cracking

97
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,920
but as a fighter pile, I knew the essence of the problem

98
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,260
these guys could not land a project

99
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,460
you know we learned as a fighter pilot that we had very carefully bed that airplane

100
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,100
 right on the end of the runway

101
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,880
and if we did

102
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,220
 it we might go halfway down the runway and slide off the runway into the trees

103
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,260
 and that's what they were doing every project

104
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,520
sliding off the runway into the trees

105
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,900
 so I went to the CEO and I said

106
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,000
 this Bank is totally screwed up

107
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,220
if you give me the worst, business unit in the bank

108
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,380
 I will fix it, just like I fixed company L2

109
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,080
and he said Sutherland if you want that headache, you've got it

110
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,980
so I said okay

111
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,420
 I will report to you once a month

112
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,140
 to you in the senior management 
and the rest of the time you stay out of my unit

113
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,600
we're going to run this as a little company at a company like a start-up

114
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,920
and so we broke them down into small team

115
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,620
 sales, marketing, installs engineering everyone

116
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,680
all working together with team incentives

117
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,640
 in a collaborative space
and we ran weekly cycles

118
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,060
 we began building a backlog of what we needed to do

119
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,200
and I began to show them how to lay in the airplane

120
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,500
how is it ?

121
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,040
that a pilot can make a perfect touchdown

122
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,960
he has to look at an altitude airspeed rate of descent

123
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,620
the heading of the airplane

124
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,360

understand the wind and the weather in every few seconds being adjusting, constantly

125
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,600
 so every week they would try to land the airplane at the end of the runway

126
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,680
bang

127
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,940
and week after week they did it

128
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,560
and surprise surprise

129
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,160
in less than six months

130
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,480
 that team, was the best team in the bank!

131
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,420
they had gone from the worst money-losing unit

132
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,720
to the most profitable use it in the back

133
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,300
because they made their work visible

134
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,820
 the team was given the responsibility to fix the problem

135
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,950
and they self-organized to make it happen

136
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,020
it's all about learning how to land the airplane

137
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,700
now from that banking experience I was asked by

138
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,770
 a series of companies to come in and deal with tough problems

139
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:15,400
so I needed to figure out how to do this consistently and get other people to do it other than me I couldn't be there all the time for everyone

140
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,970
and so I began to think about how would I do this

141
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,550
 I was running a little French company in Cambridge Massachusetts on the eye on the MIT campus

142
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,720
and five graduate students for MIT came by and they said

143
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,850
we're starting up a company building robots can you rent us some space

144
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,500
 and I said sure, We have a couple of extra rooms you can use for a lab

145
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,020
and they were building these insect-like robots

146
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,270
and every other day

147
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,660
the robots would come wandering into my office

148
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,800
they were trying to hunt me down with heat-seeking sensors

149
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,370
 and senior professor at MIT was a co-founder he would come by on Fridays, and he would

150
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,950
 see how they were doing and I asked him I said

151
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,220
 professor Brooks how do these robots work

152
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,200
he said Jeff: the first thing you understand

153
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,860
 need to understand is that for 30 years

154
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,400
 we've tried to build a smart system at MIT

155
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,860
 and it's been a total failure

156
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,150
we tried to build this command and control system

157
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,860
with really big computers and huge databases

158
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,820
 and it didn't work it

159
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,370
the best it could do was a smart chess program

160
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,240
 so he said: I watched insects, and I wanted to create

161
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,550
something that had distributed intelligence

162
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
 a chip in the leg that can move a leg

163
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,240
 a chip in the spine that can coordinate legs

164
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,510
a neural network in the head

165
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,460
 that figures out where to go

166
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,240
 and he turned it on the legs flapped and it waddle to its feed was like a baby learning how to walk and three minutes was running around the room

167
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,330
 I said wow that's amazing i used to have these really slow developers

168
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,550
 maybe we could give them some simple rules

169
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,150
 and they would learn how to boot up into a super-intelligent team do you think that work

170
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,580
and he said why don't you try it?

171
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,020
well I did a short time later

172
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:25,440
 a company a very successful company hired me in to build a new product

173
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,240
that was going to replace all the rolled products at half the time they'd ever done it before

174
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,950
and I had to figure it out

175
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,340
and our product had to be used by really big companies

176
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,860
and I had to tell them how to use the product in an agile way

177
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,700
 and we studied the literature

178
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,580
and we found the best paper in the Harvard Business Review

179
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,180
we're not gonna talk to you cheat two Japanese professors had

180
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,460
shown three different styles of leadership

181
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,860
number one: the Gantt chart

182
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,380
you know what happens with that one

183
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,760
number two a transitional strategy at Fuji xerox

184
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,040
 and number three

185
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,660
 that what they saw and the best manufacturing plants of the world

186
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,660
so we ran how to implement number three

187
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,260
 and talking Tanaka said it needs to be self-organizing self-motivated teams

188
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,160
management needs to let go and step back

189
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,180
they need to get out of the way

190
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,720
so the teams can figure out what to do

191
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:34,240
so we implemented that in 1993 by 1995 I got together with my partner Ken Schwaber

192
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,980
 we started rolling it out to industry

193
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,990
 in 2001 we wrote the agile manifesto

194
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,920
 and since then it's gone everywhere in the world

195
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,460
all the major software companies

196
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,220
they're building fighters

197
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,460
 agricultural machinery, space probes

198
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,900
 Joe justice in the picture there is showing a car company

199
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,140
how to build a car in one week cycles

200
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,620
 a new car every week

201
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,620
but the leading edge of this agile movement today

202
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,780
 is actually in the schools of the US and Europe

203
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,360
 I recently visited a school in the Netherlands

204
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,800
where the kids have been trained

205
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,860
to self learn

206
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,400
 the bell would ring they'd come running into the room

207
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,720
tease of four they would run to the wall put up their scrum boards of the wall

208
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,920
 they'd have a short daily meeting what did we do yesterday what would we do today

209
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,080
 what are the problems that are getting in the way

210
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,220
run to the desk and start to work

211
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,360
 the teachers just standing there saying nothing

212
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,580
 they only talk when they're asked for help

213
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,020
 the enthusiasm of these kids

214
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,580
was so overwhelming I'm standing there with other teachers we're crying

215
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,940
the kids say it's faster learning better grades they finish weeks early they have more fun

216
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,700
 there's a definition of fun for everything they do they make sure it's achieved

217
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,960
 the handicapped children are involved naturally in the workings of the teams as team members

218
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,160
 the motivation problems go away

219
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,340
 the disciplinary problems go away

220
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,400
the team execute self-discipline

221
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,900
 if they need a little help from the teacher they might ask for it but generally they don't need it

222
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,660
so this is the future of learning

223
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,120
and if you go back into the world that most of us live in

224
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,880
we're not operating that way

225
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,360
the surveys show that most people think work really sucks

226
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,820
the only thing worse at work is being sick in bed

227
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:55,420
I recently asked a software developer for working on BMW software in Paris

228
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,120
how he liked his scrum team

229
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,540
 he started choking up he started bursting into tears he said

230
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,520
I can't tell you the acceleration I feel it's changed my life

231
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,640
 every one of you could experience that

232
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,900
 you could grab back your power

233
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,020
 grab back your freedom

234
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,920
gain a life that's transcendent

235
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,100
and the xhilaration you would feel would give you an a happiness

236
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,880
 that you would remember till your grave

237
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,250
 that's what I wish for every person in this room

238
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,420
 and you need to give up and let go to make it happen

239
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,360
thank you very much
