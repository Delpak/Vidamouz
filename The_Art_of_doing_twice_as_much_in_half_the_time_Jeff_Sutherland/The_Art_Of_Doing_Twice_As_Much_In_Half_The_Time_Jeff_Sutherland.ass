Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.96,0:04:33.38,Default,,0,0,0,,while I was there

Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.64,0:04:56.48,Default,,0,0,0,, and while I was there
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.74,0:05:01.90,Default,,0,0,0,, a big banking company running 150 banks all over North America came by, they said 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.12,0:05:09.12,Default,,0,0,0,,you know at the University you have the best expertise in technologies we use at the bank 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.22,0:05:11.82,Default,,0,0,0,,you have all the knowledge and know that none of the money
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.92,0:05:14.78,Default,,0,0,0,,but at the bank we've got all the money
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.50,0:05:17.24,Default,,0,0,0,, and we don't know what we're doing
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.88,0:05:22.84,Default,,0,0,0,, you should come work for the bank and it would be a perfect marriage of knowledge and money
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.44,0:05:28.10,Default,,0,0,0,,and they may be an offer that my wife couldn't refuse a poor university professor
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.02,0:05:31.82,Default,,0,0,0,,so I wind up at the bank and what do I see
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.00,0:05:35.08,Default,,0,0,0,, I see they're running all these huge projects
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.62,0:05:38.50,Default,,0,0,0,, hundreds of developers
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.26,0:05:43.18,Default,,0,0,0,,and they manage all these projects with a Gantt chart
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.44,0:05:49.70,Default,,0,0,0,,and this is a technology that was introduced to the military in the United States in 1910 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.48,0:05:54.42,Default,,0,0,0,,it didn't work very well in World War one 
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.64,0:05:56.82,Default,,0,0,0,,and it didn't work very well then
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.02,0:06:02.50,Default,,0,0,0,,because every piece of the project is lined up with a date 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:02.94,0:06:05.52,Default,,0,0,0,,and if anybody misses that timing
Dialogue: 0,0:06:05.86,0:06:09.52,Default,,0,0,0,,the whole project is delayed
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.66,0:06:13.82,Default,,0,0,0,,and when it gets delayed the customers get upset the managers get angry 
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.92,0:06:19.26,Default,,0,0,0,,that would force these developers to work nights, weekends they go on death marches
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.36,0:06:22.10,Default,,0,0,0,,it reminded me of the Roman galleys you know
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.14,0:06:27.06,Default,,0,0,0,,the slaves rowing rowing the whip is cracking
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.42,0:06:32.92,Default,,0,0,0,,but as a fighter pile, I knew the essence of the problem
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.54,0:06:37.26,Default,,0,0,0,,these guys could not land a project
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.22,0:06:44.46,Default,,0,0,0,,you know we learned as a fighter pilot that we had very carefully bed that airplane
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.58,0:06:46.10,Default,,0,0,0,, right on the end of the runway
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.36,0:06:47.88,Default,,0,0,0,,and if we did
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.24,0:06:52.22,Default,,0,0,0,, it we might go halfway down the runway and slide off the runway into the trees
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.30,0:06:54.26,Default,,0,0,0,, and that's what they were doing every project
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.36,0:06:56.52,Default,,0,0,0,,sliding off the runway into the trees
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.86,0:06:59.90,Default,,0,0,0,, so I went to the CEO and I said
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.60,0:07:03.00,Default,,0,0,0,, this Bank is totally screwed up
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.58,0:07:07.22,Default,,0,0,0,,if you give me the worst, business unit in the bank
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.26,0:07:11.38,Default,,0,0,0,, I will fix it, just like I fixed company L2 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.62,0:07:16.08,Default,,0,0,0,,and he said Sutherland if you want that headache, you've got it 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.68,0:07:17.98,Default,,0,0,0,,so I said okay 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.10,0:07:20.42,Default,,0,0,0,, I will report to you once a month
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.48,0:07:25.14,Default,,0,0,0,, to you in the senior management \Nand the rest of the time you stay out of my unit 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.32,0:07:28.60,Default,,0,0,0,,we're going to run this as a little company at a company like a start-up
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.76,0:07:31.92,Default,,0,0,0,,and so we broke them down into small team
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.98,0:07:34.62,Default,,0,0,0,, sales, marketing, installs engineering everyone
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.28,0:07:37.68,Default,,0,0,0,,all working together with team incentives
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.80,0:07:41.64,Default,,0,0,0,, in a collaborative space\Nand we ran weekly cycles
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.62,0:07:46.06,Default,,0,0,0,, we began building a backlog of what we needed to do 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.06,0:07:50.20,Default,,0,0,0,,and I began to show them how to lay in the airplane
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.24,0:07:52.50,Default,,0,0,0,,how is it ? 
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.92,0:07:57.04,Default,,0,0,0,,that a pilot can make a perfect touchdown
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.14,0:08:01.96,Default,,0,0,0,,he has to look at an altitude airspeed rate of descent 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:02.14,0:08:03.62,Default,,0,0,0,,the heading of the airplane
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.76,0:08:09.36,Default,,0,0,0,,\Nunderstand the wind and the weather in every few seconds being adjusting, constantly
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.62,0:08:14.60,Default,,0,0,0,, so every week they would try to land the airplane at the end of the runway 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.80,0:08:15.68,Default,,0,0,0,,bang 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.14,0:08:19.94,Default,,0,0,0,,and week after week they did it
Dialogue: 0,0:08:20.94,0:08:23.56,Default,,0,0,0,,and surprise surprise
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.84,0:08:26.16,Default,,0,0,0,,in less than six months
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.64,0:08:31.48,Default,,0,0,0,, that team, was the best team in the bank!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.74,0:08:35.42,Default,,0,0,0,,they had gone from the worst money-losing unit
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.60,0:08:37.72,Default,,0,0,0,,to the most profitable use it in the back 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.88,0:08:40.30,Default,,0,0,0,,because they made their work visible
Dialogue: 0,0:08:41.97,0:08:45.82,Default,,0,0,0,, the team was given the responsibility to fix the problem 
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.57,0:08:50.95,Default,,0,0,0,,and they self-organized to make it happen
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.57,0:08:56.02,Default,,0,0,0,,it's all about learning how to land the airplane
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.25,0:09:01.70,Default,,0,0,0,,now from that banking experience I was asked by
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.80,0:09:05.77,Default,,0,0,0,, a series of companies to come in and deal with tough problems 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.17,0:09:15.40,Default,,0,0,0,,so I needed to figure out how to do this consistently and get other people to do it other than me I couldn't be there all the time for everyone 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.32,0:09:19.97,Default,,0,0,0,,and so I began to think about how would I do this
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.82,0:09:26.55,Default,,0,0,0,, I was running a little French company in Cambridge Massachusetts on the eye on the MIT campus
Dialogue: 0,0:09:27.62,0:09:31.72,Default,,0,0,0,,and five graduate students for MIT came by and they said
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.47,0:09:36.85,Default,,0,0,0,,we're starting up a company building robots can you rent us some space
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.47,0:09:41.50,Default,,0,0,0,, and I said sure, We have a couple of extra rooms you can use for a lab
Dialogue: 0,0:09:41.77,0:09:45.02,Default,,0,0,0,,and they were building these insect-like robots 
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.70,0:09:47.27,Default,,0,0,0,,and every other day
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.27,0:09:52.66,Default,,0,0,0,,the robots would come wandering into my office
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.73,0:09:55.80,Default,,0,0,0,,they were trying to hunt me down with heat-seeking sensors
Dialogue: 0,0:09:57.10,0:10:02.37,Default,,0,0,0,, and senior professor at MIT was a co-founder he would come by on Fridays, and he would
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.60,0:10:04.95,Default,,0,0,0,, see how they were doing and I asked him I said
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.13,0:10:08.22,Default,,0,0,0,, professor Brooks how do these robots work 
Dialogue: 0,0:10:08.68,0:10:11.20,Default,,0,0,0,,he said Jeff: the first thing you understand
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.28,0:10:13.86,Default,,0,0,0,, need to understand is that for 30 years
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.95,0:10:16.40,Default,,0,0,0,, we've tried to build a smart system at MIT
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.48,0:10:18.86,Default,,0,0,0,, and it's been a total failure 
Dialogue: 0,0:10:19.73,0:10:23.15,Default,,0,0,0,,we tried to build this command and control system
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.37,0:10:26.86,Default,,0,0,0,,with really big computers and huge databases
Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.02,0:10:28.82,Default,,0,0,0,, and it didn't work it
