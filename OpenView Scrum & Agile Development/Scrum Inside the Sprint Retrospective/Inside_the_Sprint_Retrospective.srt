1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,880
جلسه بازاندیشی اسپرینت، جلسه‌ جذابیه
now the retrospective is an interesting meeting

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,050
 افراد دور هم جمع می‌شوند و با هم در این‌باره گفتگو می‌کنند که کارهای اسپرینت قبل چطور بوده
because people get together and they talk about well how did it go for the last sprint

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,270
و اولین کاری هم که باید انجام بشه اینه که فهرستی از رویدادهای گذشته تهیه کنند
and the first thing they need to do is really recollect what happened

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,100
البته یادآوری جزییات اتفاقاتی که در چند هفته اخیر رخ داده، کار سختیه
it's hard to people remember all the details of what's happened in the last couple of weeks

5
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,950
برای همین، معمولا فردی وجود داره که نمایی از این رویدادها رو به شکل بصری آماده می‌کنه
so often they'll have people maybe make it visual,

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,480
ممکنه چیزهایی را که در این چند هفته اتفاق افتاده، روی برگه‌های رنگی یادداشت کنه. حالا هر چقدر هم که اسپرینت طول کشیده باشه
maybe put things on sticky notes all the things that happened in the last few weeks however long the Sprint has

7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,750
بعد از این، کارهایی رو که دوست داشتند از کارهایی که دوست نداشتند تفکیک می‌کنند
and then given that, picture what did they like and what didn't they like

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,640
زیرا آنچه را که دوست داشتند
because the things they like they want to keep

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,470
 and the things they didn't like they want to figure out how to do differently

10
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,390
based on understanding that

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:59,590
the team will then come up with okay here's some process improvements we can make to make our sprint better

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,394
and they'll talk about prioritizing those

13
00:01:02,394 --> 00:01:07,690
because it turns out that tuning an organization is very similar to tuning a computer

14
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,120
if your website is too slow

15
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,580
you don't want to try to fix everything at once

16
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,030
you want to identify where in that software that is there a bottleneck

17
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,380
where is the biggest bottleneck and you want to fix that first

18
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,600
when you fix it the whole system will change its dynamics

19
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,694
and the next bottleneck is often we you least expected it to be.

20
00:01:28,694 --> 00:01:32,050
so it turns out you only want to fix one thing at a time

21
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:38,390
so the challenge for that retrospective is to figure out what is the one thing that if we fixed it

22
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,840
would have the biggest impact on making this team go fast

23
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,260
and then commit to fix it

24
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,850
so the whole point of the retrospective is identifying that one thing and getting a commitment

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,936
if that thing is not identified

26
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:57,470
and it's not fixed ideally before the next retrospective

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,578
then the retrospective has been a complete waste of time

28
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,930
and people will say why are we doing this? nothing's happening.

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,790
so the retrospective is designed to fix the most important thing

30
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,680
when that happens the team will accelerate

31
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,024
they'll start to go faster,

32
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:13,840
the quality of the product will go up

33
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,690
so the retrospective is critical to improving performance of teams
