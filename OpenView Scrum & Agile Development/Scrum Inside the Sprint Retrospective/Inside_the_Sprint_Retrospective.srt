1
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,149
now the retrospective is an interesting
a meeting

2
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:20,030
 because people get together and they talk about well how did it go
for the last sprint

3
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,340
and the first thing they need to do is really recollect what
happened

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,980
it's hard to people remember all the details of what's happened in
the last couple of weeks

5
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,959
 so often they'll have people maybe make it visual,

6
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:36,210
maybe put things on sticky notes all the things that happened in the last last
few weeks however long the Sprint has

7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:42,529
and then given that picture what did
they like and what didn't they like

8
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,099
because the things they like they want
to keep and the things they didn't like they want to figure out how to do
differently

9
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:51,199
 based on understanding that

10
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:59,170
the team will then come up with okay
here's some process improvements we can make to make our sprint better

11
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,000
 and
they'll talk about prioritizing those

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,290
because it turns out that tuning an
organization is very similar to tuning a computer

13
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,180
 if your website is too slow you
don't want to try to fix everything at once

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,890
 you want to identify where in that
software that is there a bottleneck

15
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,700
where is the where is the biggest
bottleneck and you want to fix that first

16
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,939
 when you fix it the whole system
will change its dynamics

17
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:32,059
and the next
bottleneck is often we you least expected it to be. so it turns out you
only want to fix one thing at a time

18
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,009
so the challenge for that retrospective
is to figure out what is the one thing that if we fixed it

19
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:42,670
 would have the
biggest impact on making this team go fast

20
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,159
 and then commit to fix it

21
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:52,120
 so the
whole point of the retrospective is identifying that one thing and getting a
commitment

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,479
 if that thing is not identified and it's not fixed ideally
before the next retrospective

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,499
 then the
retrospective has been a complete waste of time and people will say why are we
doing this? nothing's happening.

24
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,129
so the retrospective is designed to fix
the most important thing

25
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:11,100
when that happens the team will accelerate

26
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,290
they'll
start to go faster, the quality of the product will go up

27
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:20,130
so the retrospective
is critical to improving performance of teams

28
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,680
