1
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:13,830
we created scrum to help teams function
a lot better in software development

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,830
one of the problems in software development
as projects are always late and

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,520
developers are under pressure and the
question was could we build a high-performing team like a sports team

4
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,110
where they could execute five to ten times faster than a normal team

5
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:31,389
and based on a lot of experience with Silicon Valley teams

6
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:36,260
and experience I've
had in many companies we figured out how
to do that

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,950
so for example my last company we started doing scrum in 2000

8
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,750
we built the teams there working together

9
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:49,009
it took teams when they're starting off can very quickly start working together
maybe going twice as fast

10
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,130
and then as they get their engineering practices
really working well

11
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,950
their velocity will accelerate

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:04,680
by 2005 my last company had
reached a state where they were running 10 times as fast as one of our outsource
waterfall teams in India

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,090
so it would cost us three times as much to get
software developed in India as it would do it to do it right here in Boston

14
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:18,620
that
allowed us to we had a meeting every week where the chief product owner

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,650
and scrum who was my who was working the backlog and the direction of the company

16
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,570
he could meet with all the stakeholders and decide ok,

17
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,440
this week what are the key
issues, what are the issues with the teams

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,240
what are the issues of the market,
what are the sales guys seeing

19
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,240
and he could change the backlog

20
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,450
so the next two weeks they were adjusting the direction of the technology development

21
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:45,970
and two weeks later they could have a new
release of the software to target directly the competition

22
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:54,590
so as Scott
Maxwell here at open your venture
partners points out he likes the idea
you know you line up the Canada boom

23
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,180
you take care of that part of the competition then two weeks later you
move in the Canada boom

24
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:07,490
so with thatspeed and performance and to get that
speed the teams have to be really excited and enthusiastic

25
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,860
you can't do it by forcing it so they really have to
learn how to work together,

26
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,689
get the engineering practices really good and
then they could go very fast

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,159
the tipicall traditional product development team
in the space of my last company was doing - we - releases a year one release
every six months

28
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:34,560
as they hit their peak of performance in 2005 they were doing
45 releases a year

29
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,060
when you are doing 45 releases and your competition can only
do two,

30
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,140
it is game over we had no more competition

31
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,110
so that's the that's one of
the goals of scrum from the point of view of the business side
