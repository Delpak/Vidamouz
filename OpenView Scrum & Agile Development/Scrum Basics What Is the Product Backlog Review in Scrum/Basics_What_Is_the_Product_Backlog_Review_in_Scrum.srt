1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,046
once the product owner has a product backlog,

2
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,230
that's useful for starting the sprint

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,119
he needs to meet with the team

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:23,020
before they go into planning for the sprint to look at the backlog, review it  and estimate its sizing

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,550
and in scrum we use relative sizing

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,650
and we often call them story points for use we measure the size of backlog items and points

7
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,830
once that's clear to the development team

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,520
then they're ready to start the first sprint with a sprint planning session

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,180
in that session they'll bring the product backlog in

10
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,390
the team will decide how much backlog they think they can implement

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,960
in a sprint which is often one week two weeks three weeks no more than four weeks

12
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,930
and they will pull from the back product backlog

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,080
that's one of the things that's very different from scrum

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,750
it's based on Lean principles where you pull into the system

15
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:01,960
nobody's pushing stuff on to the team

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,470
what the lean companies have found out is a push process slows things down

17
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,050
so the team pulls off of that backlog in sprint planning

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,720
they then will spend some time maybe breaking that backlog down into smaller pieces

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,930
and figuring out what they're what they're going to do

20
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,460
they may even take those small pieces and estimate how many hours it's going to take to implement them

21
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:30,130
so they can see you know do they have as much time as they need to to get done what they plan

22
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,850
and when they really have looked at that and they feel comfortable with it

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,230
 then it's a responsibility of the team to commit to deliver that in the two weeks

24
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,910
and that kicks off the Sprint
