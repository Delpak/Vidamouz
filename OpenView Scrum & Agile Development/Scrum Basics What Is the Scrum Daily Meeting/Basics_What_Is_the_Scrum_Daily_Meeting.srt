1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:15,680
the daily meeting during the sprint is a
critical component of making teams
successful

2
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:22,090
and from the beginning we've always had the three questions that
needed to be asked

3
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,730
had to do what an each person do ,what are they going to do
and are there any problems or impediments getting in their way

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,609
 now it turns out when people start scrum

5
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:38,110
 people think it's all about them but it's not
about them. it's about the team

6
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,569
the goal is for the team to perform as well as
possible

7
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:49,590
so if you have a really dynamic team, person will say I did this
yesterday; I had these problems.

8
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,440
 the team might in a very quick time have some
ideas about how to correct those problems

9
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:01,239
 I'm going to do this today. the
team members may say well how are you going to do that

10
00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:07,029
 at when that's
described they may say hey you know another member of the team; I can help
you

11
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:09,529
 we could get this done in an hour together

12
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:12,159
 the way you're going to do it
alone it may take a day or two so

13
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,620
 so let's work together to make it go faster

14
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,740
and so it's all about the team talking each person talking about what they've
done, what they're going to do,

15
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,570
 but the
team figuring out together how that's going to work really well and really
fast

16
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,220
 so that dynamic of teams helping one another out during that daily
meeting is really important

17
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,240
the meeting is short it's only 15 minutes

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,900
so and
many of the teams I've worked with they've had a 60 second rule

19
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,180
 you know we
can talk about one issue for no more than 60 seconds

20
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,490
 if we don't solve it by
then we'll kick it into a later meeting right after the scrum meeting to make
sure we finish it in 15 minutes

21
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:54,580
so these dynamics of the way that meeting works
are extremely critical

22
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,550
and there are many teams that need a lot of coaching
to get that right

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,420
you
