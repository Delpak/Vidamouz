سلام. به آکادمی اجایل خوش آمدید
hi and welcome to the agile Academy

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,976
در این گفتگو از سری گفتارهای چابکی و تجربه
In this Agile in practice talk

3
00:00:05,024 --> 00:00:08,864
we'd like to address how agile teams come up with a definition of done 

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,584
that will help them to decide when the work is completed

5
00:00:11,664 --> 00:00:13,312
For agile teams

6
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:19,020
done means that nothing more needs to be done, for a piece of work to be taken into production or go live

7
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:22,608
while agile teams come to an agreement on the definition of done

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,248
they will brainstorm what tasks need to be done 

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,120
and what artifacts need to be produced to bring a single story or a piece of functionality into production

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,512
they will identify what can be done and what can't be done

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,616
they will also capture the blockers for the can't be done items

12
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:40,620
And then get consensus on what can be done items the

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,272
definition of done is important for agile teams to accurately measure the progress of their work

14
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:50,432
the whole team including their customer Jen the HR team leader

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,152
is involved in coming to a definition of done and they revisit irregularly to update it

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,032
here is Susan the business analyst of the team

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,912
she explains what the definition of done is to the team so they could get a shared understanding

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,400
essentially done means that the customer our product owner is happy with what the team has delivered

19
00:01:08,512 --> 00:01:11,168
and has signed off and all the stories

20
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:12,704
however she continues

21
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,960
since the story goes through a development process, you can identify smaller checkpoints of done along the way

22
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,328
For example only after I have captured enough acceptance criteria and assumptions for a user story 

23
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:27,392
can it be picked up by the developers 

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,768
since all of this information doesn't fit on a story card

25
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,872
I capture them and what I like to call a narrative which is my artifact to express done

26
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,288
these might be a sketch of a feedback form

27
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:39,888
a prototype screen shot

28
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:42,112
and even some technical considerations

29
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,024
Tom the developer continues the explanation

30
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:47,632
in order to get a story closer to done

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,432
my piece of work has to be reviewed by another developer

32
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,856
and successfully integrated into the current version of the solution

33
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:54,992
Damien says

34
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:57,808
another checkpoint on the road to getting a story done

35
00:01:57,856 --> 00:02:00,688
is that we have implemented the feedback of users

36
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:03,936
ensuring that a story meets user experience satisfaction

37
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:10,464
above all it means that Jen, as our customer and product owner
has tested the story and approved it

38
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:16,688
in fact a story is done when it passes all tests created based on the acceptance criteria Susan

39
00:02:16,816 --> 00:02:19,024
our business analyst has captured

40
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,168
this will include performance tests 

41
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:26,250
which means testing the response time of the system when a lot of people use it at the same time

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,136
that's our definition of done as developers

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,408
what about for you as a product owner Jen?

44
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:36,464
well Damian as a customer I'd say that the work is done when the employees over company 

45
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,904
have an easy-to-use system

46
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:40,976
in which they can fill in and access performance feedback

47
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,536
bill sums up the team's discussion

48
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,344
So let's have a look at what we are come up with for our definition of done

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,896
whether it is a story 

50
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,688
a feature, an iteration

51
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:53,130
or for a whole release of our product or a system

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,680
the work is done when we as a team

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,048
truly believe that we will not have to touch it again

54
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:00,080
in this agile and practice talk

55
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,864
you learned that agile teams come to consensus about what done means when the user definition to track the progress of their work

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,660
this progress is displayed in burnt charts

57
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,592
and agile metric that is a topic for another time
