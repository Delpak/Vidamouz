Hi! and welcome to the agile Academy

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,080
In this agile in practice talk 

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,910
we'd like to give you a quick insight into stand-ups

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,180
 and how they work for agile teams

5
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,530
Let me introduce you to the team 

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,170
 they are working on the new employee performance review system 

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,620
and are getting together for their daily meeting 

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,620
every day at the same time the team stands in a semicircle at the team wall 

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,490
 and turn each team member gives an update by shearing 

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,790
what work that I complete yesterday?

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,270
what do I plan to complete today?

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,000
what blocker, if any, do I face and getting my work done today?

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,640
Here is Bill. kicking off the stand up 

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,830
yesterday I completed the first version of the new performance review flier

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,280
and today, I will start the FAQ list 

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,640
my blocker is that some of the HR experts I need to talk with aren't available

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,150
They're on a team day

18
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,690
bill then passes on the Talking Stick to Megan

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,510
Who shares her update with the group

20
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,880
(*)Megan might see 

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,310
yesterday I completed not much since my computer crashed

22
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,830
 and so today I'll be catching up with my work on testing the systems login security

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,910
 new blockers since I got a temporary computer to work on

24
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,400
 Megan passes a talking stick on to Damien 

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,420
who is next? 

26
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,630
the team purposely has this meeting while standing up 

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,310
 because it helps him to focus on answering just these three questions 

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,960
keeping the stand up short and sharp

29
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,480
 since they take problem resolution outside of this meeting 

30
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,230
and the frame from storytelling

31
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,810
 their stand up takes no more than 15 minutes at the max 

32
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,670
guests and non core team members are welcome to the stand up

33
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,930
 but they can only listen 

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,050
and cannot actively participate

35
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,870
 Jen the business subject-matter expert

36
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,320
 thinks that the daily stand-up is very useful

37
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,260
 she says 

38
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,340
even though I don't actively participate in the stand up

39
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,760
 I know where we are with the work as a team

40
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,600
 if there are any issues that I can solve I get on it straight away 

41
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,990
 Megan adds

42
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,370
 what I find challenging about the stand up

43
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,180
 is keeping what I share relevant to my teammates

44
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,060
so that I don't waste our time with just some general update statements

45
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:13,470
 and short stand-ups or brief daily meetings that are made to get everyone updated on the progress of the work that your team has committed to 

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,810
and of any obstacles that are in the way 

47
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,970
 since you all share your updates with the whole team

48
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,170
as stand-up is not a micromanagement report to the project manager or team lead

49
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,730
the project manager is mainly there to hear about the blockers

50
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,710
 it is his or her tasks to remove these obstacles as quickly as possible

51
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,590
 we hope you enjoyed this Agile in practice talk 

52
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,580
and that it encourages you to try out stand ups with your own team
